Are the primary depots of pathogens best targets for OCIs?
We performed a structured meta-analysis in which we assessed randomised and non-randomised clinical trials, and observational studies that investigated the relative efficacy of enhanced OCI programmes on NVAP.
Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement, 11 a systematic literature appraisal was performed.
Towards a better understanding of study characteristics.
Experimental and observational studies were included based on the following criteria: 1. Reported NVAP as a primary outcome .
We excluded studies which used the term 'hospital-acquired pneumonia' but did not differentiate NVAP from VAP.
Data extraction from eligible studies, independently, using pre-specified data extraction forms.
Reviewers independently extracted and assessed the risk of bias for randomised controlled trials .

Oral hygiene intervention was not uniform and varied principally in two ways: who performed the oral hygiene intervention and whether an antimicrobial rinse was included in the Oral hygiene regimen.
 enhanced oral hygiene performed by a dedicated nursing assistant significantly reduced NVAP outcomes compared to no oral care .
Formal dental training results in demonstrably superior outcomes.
A dedicated nursing assistant is equivalent to a dental professional in terms of NVAP risk modification.

Ebolaviruses are a group of viruses with negative polarity, capable of causing disease in humans.
Ebola virus outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo .
Ebola is a public health emergency of international concern .
Ebola virus can infect people of all ages-from infants to elderly-and infection can affect fetal development and viability.
Most human-to-human Ebola transmission is by direct exposure of the mucous membranes or non-intact skin to infectious body fluids such as blood, vomitus, stool, or with contaminated materials.
Up to 500 days after recovery ; however, the viability and infectivity of the virus isolated from these sites is less certain.
Ebola virus uses its structural and membrane proteins through a number of mechanisms to evade the host immune response.
Direct viral cytopathy, endothelial dysfunction, coagulation disruption, and the host's own inflammatory response .
Clinical suspicion of EVD should arise when considering a patient's clinical syndrome and recent likelihood of exposure in an area where the virus is known to circulate .
Ebola-specific care advances including vaccine prevention, point-of-care diagnostics and a wider consensus on provision of optimized care and an increased acceptance and capacity to conduct well-designed research are leading to improved clinical outcomes for patients.
Contact history: transmission, or contact history with infected persons or dead or possibly infected animals.
Re-testing all patients in whom clinical suspicion persists even after initial plasma RT-PCR results are negative if symptoms have been present for fewer than few days .
The first phase of illness can be mild, with fever, vomiting and diarrhoea .
In the third phase of illness, multi-organ failure may occur, with acute kidney failure, hepatic failure, cardiac dysfunction and shock.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends confirmation of Ebola virus infection by RTquantitative PCR.
Infections such as malaria and bacterial infections should be considered , since these are often assumed to co-exist with Ebola in severely ill patients and may lead to over-prescription of antimalarials.
Elevation in RDTs for the detection of Ebola virus .

Neurological complications such as altered mental status , seizures, agitation and encephalopathy were reported in over 30% of patients treated in Europe and West Africa .
A systematic review evaluated the potential effect of different anti-Ebola therapies on clinical outcomes of EVD patients.
ZMapp failed to reach the pre-set threshold of 97.5% probability to establish efficacy.
REGN-EB3 is a cocktail of three monoclonal antibodies targeting non-overlapping epitopes of Ebola virus.
MAb114 is a human monoclonal antibody that targets a highly conserved epitope on the receptor-binding domain of the Ebola virus glycoprotein, thus preventing its interaction with the host cell receptor protein and blocking viral entry.
MAb114 and REGN-EB3 were found to be superior to ZMapp in reducing 28-day mortality.
The mortality rate in patients receiving remdesivir was 53.1%.
Management of patients with Ebola has evolved substantially over the past decade from a clinical perspective of isolation and provision of oral rehydration therapy to one of treating the syndromic illness.

We identified significant reductions in injury severity and severe head injury associated with increased in bike lane miles.
We found a reduction in mortality even with dramatic increases in ridership.
 helmet use and cycling infrastructure changes reduced severe head injuries in cycling accidents.
Increasing bicycle infrastructure results in increasing ridership, but it is likely confounded by increasing social acceptance and overall popularity of cycling.
Cyclists are less seriously injured when there are more cyclists and miles of protected bike space.
Minneapolis made several different types of cycling infrastructure changes during the study period.
Our study has the typical limitations of a single center study and bias associated with reliance on a database to identify our study cohort.
We have demonstrated a pronounced reduction in the severity of injuries incurred by cyclists in the setting of a significant increase of bicycle lane miles.

We found significant relations between the two markers and oxygenation index, duration of ventilation, and duration of hospitalization.
Mechanical Ventilation can induce oxidative stress, which plays a critical role in pulmonary injury in intubated neonates.
Hyperoxic exposure, although essential for the survival of RDS infants, probably induces excessive production of ROS in the respiratory system.
In this paper, we look at the relationship between protein content and protein content, and how protein content affects protein content.
We found that increased oxidative stress is accompanied by reduced antioxidant defense since day 0 and day 3 levels of TAC were decreased in patients with RDS compared with the control group.
RDS observed: RDS observed in this group.
The limitation of this study is that MDA was assessed by a colorimetric kit for TBARS.
A biomarker of oxidative stress, as well as other markers of antioxidant stress, are warranted.

Hospital management must actively manage the supply of fixed resources, such as beds and specialized equipment, that affect care quality and ensure patient safety.
Supply to demand is difficult because the future patient resource demands are random and unknown, while the resource supply is often set far in advance and difficult to adjust.
Uncertainty in patient resource demand is caused by several stochastic processes, including the number and timing of arrivals and discharges, length of stay , unit transfers, health improvement and deterioration, surgical complications, and same-day cancellations.
Short-term staffing adaptations are made to manage the mismatch of resource supply and demand, such as incorporating on-call and per diem staff.

Convex down forecasting of MAE increases is slower than the increase of the mean of unknown patients.
The Q-Q plots in Fig. 7 demonstrate that a normal distribution with the forecasted mean and variance is a suitable estimation of the full probability convolution.
Q-Q plots for multi-day forecast lengths tend to have high outliers below the 45-degree line, suggesting that consistent multi- day volume increases may be mitigated over several days via reduced LOS.
In extreme cases, a full hospital may prohibit non-critical short-term scheduling, or demonstrate a greater urgency to discharge current patients to make room for new ones.
The parameterization could benefit from the application of machine learning algorithms and additional data, especially data that is updated during the patient visit.

Routine abdominal drainage should not be used because it Bincreased the rate of all-cause morbidity, reoperations, and anastomotic leaks....
We looked at preoperative characteristics that might have led to drains being placed, operative variables that were associated with drain placement, and postoperative complications in those patients receiving drains.
We queried the MBSAQIP database for the years 2015-2017.
This study is exempt from institutional review, and therefore can be considered exempt.
Inclusion criteria included all patients undergoing surgery that are reported in the MBSAQIP database.
The preoperative characteristics of patients with and without drainage were examined including demographics and preoperative comorbidities.
Unplanned postoperative myocardial infarction, postoperative cardiac arrest requiring CPR, and stroke/cerebral vascular accident.
Unadjusted and adjusted association of drain usage with selected outcomes of interest .

WD patients underwent a provocative test to check the anastomosis/staple line more frequently .
Drain patients had an increased risk of developing leaks and a higher risk of readmission and reoperation .
 LRGYB patients had a drain placed in SG while LRYGB patients did not.
Gastric bypass patients WD had a higher rate of reoperation and readmission . The anastomosis was also more frequently checked in SG WD vs ND .
Revisional bariatric patients are more likely to have a routine swallow study and have the anastomosis checked more .
An increase in the rates of death, reoperation, and readmission .
What kind of patients get drains placed and why? Our findings indicate patients with higher BMI, serious comorbidities, and previous foregut surgery are more likely to have a drain placed.
The MBSAQIP database has no information on drainage used in intraoperative cases.
The use of abdominal drainage after bariatric surgery is decreasing with time.
We found an increased relative risk of complications in patients that had abdominal drainage .
An ability to differentiate between statistical association and causality.
Drain is a Bsymptom^of a higher-risk patient, not a Bcause^of complications and increased morbidity.
Alizadeh et al. felt the APR for leaks with drainage was likely a selection bias, which is supported by the current paper.
Drains can be used to detect bleeding and also leaks.
In cases of uncertainty and/or an unstable patient, prompt operative exploration is paramount.
The use of drains over the study period in patients undergoing gastric bypass decreased over time.
In this paper, we look at the role of early detection and early treatment in improving the quality of life.
Selective usage of drains may be necessary in some cases, but selected usage of drain placement is not.
In all cases for that specific surgeon, the question on drainage could be answered.
Sleeves are now the most commonly performed bariatric operation in the USA.
The study period was similar to what was found in the LRYGB patients.
The specific question of whether drains are useful to facilitate detection of leaks or bleeding after SG was studied by Curro et al.
Lap banding to SG: a simple, simple, and effective change .
Drainage in revisions in the MBSAQIP is equivalent to the rate of drainage in LRYGB but remained more consistent over the study period.
The MBSAQIP database only captures data from accredited bariatric centers and therefore Table 3 Adjusted associations may not accurately depict the true incidence of complications in the whole population of bariatric patients.
We can infer that surgeons left drains in higher-risk patients, but there may be a sizeable percentage of surgeons who routinely leave drains.
A small effect, but it's a small effect.
Patients with drains are more likely to have a provocative test and a swallow study.

A lack of psychometrically sound and age-appropriate measures to study care competencies in adolescents.
A reliable measure of care competency in adolescents; and based on this, empirically examine the well-being outcomes associated with different level of adolescents' care competencies.
What Is Care? Toward an Integrated Definition .
Care demands more than just good intention; good care is a practice of combining activities, attitudes, and knowledge .
Caring implies both a person one-caring and a person cared-for.
Self-care is getting accepted as an indispensable dimension.
The MLI reflects the relational nature of care through a framework of three interdependent dimensions: receiving care, selfcare and extending care.
A cognitive and affective framework for extending care .
Extending care is connected to other constructs such as social support, empathy, altruism, prosocial behavior, mindfulness and compassion .
No consensus on the definition of well-being .
Well-being is about: the presence of positive emotions and moods ; the absence of negative emotions ; and satisfaction with life, fulfillment and positive functioning.
High level of well-being would not be expected to show high level of ill-being.
Social support perceived and received from families, teachers or classmates increased adolescents' life satisfaction and positive affect and decreased their depressive symptomatology and negative affect.
Well-being is a state of mind, and we can improve our well-being.
Cognitive and affective empathy training reduced bullying , cyberbullying and aggressive behavior of adolescents . Besides, stronger mindfulness, compassion and self-compassion interventions resulted in lower negative affect and higher happiness.
A cross-cultural multi-study by showed that the combination of received social support and compassion for others predicted decreases in stress level.
No empirical study has directly and simultaneously examined the relationship between all three dimensions of care competencies and well-being.

A study on the effect of academic achievement on care competencies/failures.
Extending care competencies are better than extending care failures (η 2 = .02, b = .09)
Older adolescents experienced more emotional and behavioral difficulties, and perceived stress, than younger adolescents.
Adolescents from richer families have better life satisfaction than those from poorer ones (p = .02, b = .07), compared to younger ones.
Care competencies/failures are negatively related with life satisfaction and positive with perceived stress and emotional and behavioral difficulties .
Care competencies/failures explained an additional 18% of variance in perceived stress.
To summarize: to be a unique predictor of life satisfaction.
An interaction between self-care competencies and receiving care competencies emerged, predicting perceived stress in adolescents .
The effect of receiving care competencies on perceived stress .
I feel comfortable to receive support from others when in need because receiving support is part of being human.
I am happy, but I do not know who to share this happiness with.
A personal problem that I need help with, and I don't know who I can turn to.

An Assessment of Care Competencies and Well-being in Adolescents .
Clustering of positive and negative items in self-report measures does not cluster into three competency factors.
Negative components of self-compassion reflect two distinct constructs .
A person who does not tend to change his personal plans because of others' plans does not necessarily make time for his hobbies .
CFA confirmed the 6-factor model, distinguishing a competency and failure dimension in each of the three care dimensions.
Relationships between the six factors and self-care competencies .
Interactions between care dimensions in the prediction of perceived stress two distinct systems; adolescents can both feel competent in self-care and experience failure.
Girls possess higher levels of receiving care, self-care and extending care competencies, compared to boys.
Empathy is seen as a more "feminine" trait that more acceptable for women, women may have learned to both communicate and recognize it more easily .
Self-care competencies and care failures are two different experiences.
Adolescents with adaptive social and emotional competencies are most likely to excel in school .
Self-care failures and well-being are significantly related.
High level of care competencies and perceived stress seems to imply that high level of these two competencies is somewhat stressful.
Self-coldness is more strongly related to depressive symptoms than self-kindness.
Opening up to and cherishing the fact that other people care about them, helps adolescents to feel connected, needed, and included in the lives of others.
Self-care and extending care competencies can enhance adolescents' well-being because the need for competence to be fulfilled.
Adolescents who stop criticizing themselves tend to value themselves, which increases their self-efficacy.
Self-criticism and maladaptive perfectionism may put adolescents under pressure, which in turn leads to lower self-worth.
In this study, not much evidence for interaction between care dimensions and well-being.
Compassionate care workers experience lower stress, regardless of their competency to extend care.
The study was entirely based on self-reports, which might have inflated some of the findings, partly due to social desirable answering.
Cross-sectional data do not prevent us from assessing associations among variables, they constrain our ability to draw strong conclusions and to make causal inferences.
We selected valid questionnaires, but the reliability of some scales may occur due to the fact that part of the data was gathered right after the biggest flood since 1999 in Vietnam.
The study was limited to 14-17-year-old adolescents, caution is needed to build on these data when looking at youngsters in early adolescence .
We linked care competences to well being, but we did not develop an extensive model about the relationship between care and well-being.
The CCQA provides an appropriate and valid instrument for measuring care competencies in educational contexts.

Conditional Place Preference for Opioid-Targeted Vaccines .
A complete dose-effect function of the opioid agonist under both active vaccine and control conditions, inferences regarding vaccine effectiveness to produce clinically relevant potency shifts in the target opioid agonists are difficult to make.
A second limitation of using conditioned place preference procedures for vaccine effectiveness is the selection of what time point to evaluate vaccine effectiveness relative to vaccine administration.
Preclinical studies demonstrate opioid vaccines can decrease the ability of the targeted opioid to produce a conditioned place preference, but evaluation of potency shifts, time course, and selectivity of vaccine effectiveness would require a significant number of subjects.
A poor reliability of conditioned place preference procedures for OUD medications .
Naltrexone, buprenorphine, and methadone are clinically available OUD treatments, but their utility is limited by either poor patient compliance or abuse liability concerns.

PR x index for autoregulation in severe RFS patients .
The RAP index has been introduced as a descriptor of the pressure-volume compensatory capacity and it is also applied for characterizing the cerebral compensatory reserve in patients with hydrocephalus .
A severely ill RFS patient seemed to have a compensatory reserve varying within the interval from normal to low throughout the entire monitoring time, without signs of complete exhaustion.
RAP trend in RAP, from day 2 to day 10, was decreasing.
Multi-organ failure was displayed by this RFS patient, and this enhances the need for cautious interpreting indexes of cerebrovascular autoregulation and compensatory capacity.
Injuries can be caused by disease specific and dependent of type of injury.
A patient with anorexia nervosa was initially hemodynamically unstable, but was stabilized when the HRV recording started on day 2.
The sedation level was gradually reduced, which was also when the activity in the VLF component started to increase.
We speculate that the changes seen in the HRV were related to the level of sedation as well as autonomous recovery.
This patient has a rare and serious condition which may be difficult to recognize and may lead to death.

ECMO can be either veno-venous cannulation , which is the main or preferred modality for cardiac support system like postoperative cardiac surgery and cardiogenic shock.
A study on sepsis in ECMO population .
The risk factors for developing septic complications in ECMO include: a. Age: Adult patients who undergo ECMO are at greater risk for developing a nosocomial infection and sepsis than neonates and children .
The incidence of infection increased proportionately with time on ECMO .
The presence of foreign devices, such as central venous catheters, intra-arterial lines, large-bore ECMO cannulae, endotracheal tubes, and intra-aortic balloon pumps, all cause disruption of the protective barrier mechanism of skin and help pathogens gain

The most frequent infective agent during ECMO is coagulase-negative staphylococcus .
Candida spp. are another common and important pathogen causing infections during ECMO support .
The ECMO cannulae and membrane oxygenators can be colonized with CoNS and Candida spp. with subsequent BSI .
The urinary isolates found in the study by Sun et al. were E. coli and Candida albicans .
Gram-negative pathogens were predominant in both RTI and BSI.
No Indian data or studies revealing the etiological agents of sepsis specifically in ECMO .
Clinical scoring like Acute Physiologic Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation and SOFA scores have been given importance now in early identification of sepsis.
Sepsis is defined as occurrence of a documented nosocomial infection such as pneumonia, bacteremia, catheter-derived infections, and surgical site infections .
A high index of suspicion is very important to detect early sepsis and reduce mortality in high-risk patients.
An ECMO patient with a fever of 101 degrees or more is likely to have a high inflammatory response and should be closely monitored for other signs of infection.
White blood cell counts for nosocomial infections in patients on ECMO .
PCT with cutoff of 2 had a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 82% with a positive
Predictive value of PCT after prolonged systemic malperfusion .
Sepsis in ICU patients and this can be easily extrapolated for ECMO patient also.
Sepsis on clinical grounds requires routine tests including complete blood counts, liver and kidney function tests, urine analysis, and chest X-ray.
Drawing a serum procalcitonin at baseline and serial measurements later to see the trend may be helpful.
No data to support the use of routine antibiotic prophylaxis in ECMO patients .
Prophylactic antibiotics should not be used for transthoracic cannulation .
Treatment of sepsis after ECMO cannulation should follow the same principles as with ICU patients who are not on ECMO.

The ESLO infectious disease task force strongly recommends that in view of high incidence and high mortality of candida sepsis in ECMO subset, clinicians should keep the threshold low for starting antifungal therapy.
ECMO is the class of choice in the hemodynamically unstable patients and this stands true for ECMO population too.
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics changes during extracorporeal circuit .
The ECMO circuit causes capillary leakage and edema which can increase the volume of distribution .
Vancomycin is the most common drug studied for PK/PD variations in ECMO .
Infection control is an integral part in the management of sepsis in ECMO patients.
No routine sampling from the ECMO circuit to avoid any kind of contamination.
Chlorhexidine should be used as the agent of disinfection rather than povidone iodine or alcohol.
Prolonged total parenteral nutrition should be discouraged in these patients and efforts are made for early initiation of enteral feeds so as to improve the integrity of gut and to prevent future risk of gut translocation .
A high index of suspicion and early and timely administration of appropriate empirical antimicrobials can substantially decrease the morbidity and mortality in this high-risk population.

Revision procedures may be indicated to remove residual disease, decompress neurovascular structures, or as a planned second stage procedure.
Surgical approach and surgical technique are important, but there are also peripheral considerations.
An endoscopic skull base room should include the following: an operating room table capable of being turned 180°away from the anesthetist and ventilator as well as providing adequate incline for reverse Trendelenberg positioning to decrease bleeding, at least one, though preferably two, high-resolution

We considered federal and state laws governing the withholding or withdrawing of lifesustaining care from disabled neonates.
BDR and BAIPPA are federal statutory provisions that impose certain requirements on states as a condition of accepting federal child abuse prevention and treatment funds .
In the treating physician's or physicians' reasonable medical judgment:
Treatment of a comatose neonate would only prolong the death of the neonate and would not be effective in correcting or ameliorating the conditions.
BAIPA is a second federal law that has an intent similar to that of BDR.
EMTALA, combined with the BAIPA, may therefore be understood to require some treatment of extremely premature infants who are born with a heartbeat or other signs of life.
EMTALA is not a BDR or BAIPA, and as long as it is appropriate to characterize any care withheld from very premature neonates as being futile .
Congenital malformations, deformations, and chromosomal abnormalities were noted to be primary causes of neonatal death.

Neonatal donors, especially anencephalic donors, provide a unique set of challenges to an OPO.
Neonatal anencephalic donation requires flexibility and establishment of contingency plans.
The challenges faced by OPOs in coordinating anencephalic donors fall largely into one of three categories: donor identification and referral; family and staff counseling; donation logistics.
In this paper, we propose protocols for both OPO and hospital staff to manage these cases.
Pregnant women and neonatal practitioners in brain injury cases are asked to make a series of decisions about their own health and that of their baby.

Families should be aware of potential legal and ethical barriers to donation and the fact not all OPOs are currently equipped to provide this service even if the request falls within acceptable standards.
Family donation of organs and tissues from a neonate represents a desire to make an altruistic gift and can play a key role in the care and support provided by hospital staff at the time of the neonate's pending death.

Who did and did not have VTE? An analysis of VTE and its effects .
Predictive accuracy and potential patient impact of our VTE algorithm were compared to current PTS/EAST guidelines in a real-world analysis.
A retrospective review identified 8271 patients with 30 episodes of VTE during the study period.
Children with VTE were older, more severely injured, and more likely to have pelvic or lower extremity fractures than those without VTE .
The VTE prediction algorithm classified 51 patients as high risk, 322 patients as moderate risk and 7898 patients as low risk .
Moderate-or high-risk patients were more likely to be admitted to the ICU, intubated, receive a blood product transfusion, have a CVL placed, undergo major surgery, or die as a result of their injuries.
Prophylaxis of the moderate-and high-risk cohorts would outperform the sensitivity and specificity of current guidelines while anticoagulating substantially fewer patients .
We provide dual-center evaluation of our VTE prediction algorithm through an analysis of locally maintained, institutional trauma registries with excellent model fidelity.

We performed an additional analysis identifying alternative cutoffs for prophylactic intervention in an effort to demonstrate the utility of our algorithm.
We propose two alternative analyses of the VTE prediction algorithm where either sensitivity/specificity are maximized or positive predictive value is maximized use of pharmacologic prophylaxis.
Maximizing sensitivity and specificity-an ideal screening test, but sacrificing positive predictive value.
The use of pharmacologic prophylaxis in our population confounds some of our results.
Inclusion of pharmacologic prophylaxis in our study might have led to underestimation of the incidence of VTE by 30% at most.
We recognize that this study is insufficiently powered to completely evaluate the efficacy of a ten-variable prediction model.
Some of the patients evaluated in the application study were used to derive the model.
We use high-risk criteria at each institution and the clinical characteristics used to support our model, leading to possible artificial inflation of the AUROC.
A retrospective review of institutional trauma registries, with selected case validation through dedicated data abstraction, represents the best forum for analysis of this data, prior to a safe prospective validation study.
We provide the first application of our VTE prediction algorithm to a retrospective institutionally controlled database, demonstrating its potential utility in identifying moderate-and high-risk injured children.

We found that if only one of the six viruses were included in the assay, the results could give 10.2% miss rate of the neutralizing antibody of the positive serum samples .
Cross-neutralization studies using serum samples from naturally infected animals failed to differentiate BoHV-1.2, reflecting these subtypes' high degree of structural/antigenic similarity.
Type-specific VNT tests are not practical and difficult to perform in cattle.
We found that both BoHV-1.1 and 1.2a subtypes were circulating simultaneously in the same herd .

Bolstering neurocritical care support to rural hospitals through telemedicine technology may provide an avenue to bridge some of the clinical gaps in care and improve ICH outcome in these centers.
This study uses a national database to assess ruralurban variations in ICH mortality in the USA.
We likely underestimate true mortality gaps between patients residing in rural and urban areas because definition of rural location was based on hospital location and not residential area of patients.
DNR is often the initial process of the negotiations relating to withdrawal/withholding of life sustaining therapies .
Changes in CBSA codes in 2014 to utilize 2010 Census data may have resulted in reclassification of rural hospitals as urban in the last year of the study.
We were unable to adjust for other important factors such as mode of transportation, neurosurgical coverage or intensive care unit status because this information is not available in our dataset.
We could not provide information on radiological severity of ICH by virtue of inherent limitations in our database.
We cannot exclude residual confounding due to uncontrolled factors in our multivariable models.
Rural hospitals in most census regions are more likely to die compared to urban hospitals.
Cardiopulmonary bypass in combination with anaesthesia, medication, vascular injury and surgical stress affects the extent of inflammatory response.

Prophylactic administration of C1INH before CPB is an effective therapeutic approach to reduce the inflammatory response and improve clinical parameters after cardiac surgery.
C1-inhibitor, called C1 inactivator, covalently binds to and inhibits the active sites of activated C1r and C1s in the C1 step of the classical pathway to suppress complement activation.
C3a and C5a strongly induced by the classical pathway initiated by C1 activation, is deeply involved .
C1-INH-treated group significantly reduces complement components, suggesting suppressed complement reduction.
C1 INH is an important regulator of plasma protein cascade systems such as the classical pathway of complement, the intrinsic pathway of coagulation and inflammatory reactions.
We found that C1-inh can be used as an anesthetic, but we did not find a difference in postoperative CLS between those who did and did not receive the drug.
A single-center study with limited sample size and restrictive inclusion may place some limitations on generalizability.

Pseudomonas syringae in A. chinensis flowers and leaves .
A synergistic copresence of two pathovars has been previously observed , suggesting that, in nature, they may be active as a pathogenic consortium rather than independent pathogens.
Psa could not be detected in free soil samples collected from infected orchards, nor in proximity of roots over 1 cm in diameter.

Psa cells spread from the exuding cankers to leaves and young shoots.
Biovar 2 multiplies epiphytically, rapidly reaching the infection threshold.
In favourable conditions, high humidity conditions, leaf spots can produce ethylene that can also suppress ABAmediated stomata closure .
Psa migrates from overwintering organs to buds, where the pathogen multiplies and can cause the failure of bud break or the shoot dieback.
A disease cycle of the bacterial canker of Actinidia.
In Italy, when the temperature rises above 22°C and leaf wetness falls below 4 h per days, the disease undergoes a latency period that overlaps with the summer period.

Diurnal changes in the proteome and the granule content in neutrophils were associated with the severity of pulmonary inflammation.
Neutrophil 'disarming' in humans could underlie the circadian changes in vascular inflammation.
Neutrophil counts increase over time and peaked at 14:00-19:00 , while the granularity of neutrophils decreased from 8:00 to 19:00 .
Neutrophils isolated in density gradients at 8:00 and 14:00 from the blood of five healthy volunteers were differentially enriched with proteins related to vesicle-mediated transport, secretion, exocytosis or degranulation .
Neutrophils purified using density gradients and treated with vehicle or PMA showed a marked reduction in NET-forming capacity between 8:00 and 14:00 .
Diurnal degranulation also occurred in circulating human neutrophils.
We tested whether the changes in proteome, granule content and NET-forming activity in human neutrophils were associated with variations in the susceptibility to develop inflammation and/or its severity.

Preparation of potential threats 12 protects against excessive inflammation, vascular damage and death.
The neutrophil proteome is subject to circadian regulation, which blunts the ability of neutrophils to release toxic mediators and to produce NETs.
Neutrophils synthesize and store the majority of their early-response mediators inside dedicated organelles.
Neutrophils that migrate into tissues during the day 10 would have lost part of their antimicrobial arsenal, and would be, as such, less likely to elicit organ damage, as shown in the mouse model of ALI.
Neutrophils released from the bone marrow in conditions of stress are better suited to regulate physiological aspects of target organs than neutrophils that enter the tissues at the end of their life cycle.
Neutrophils recovered from naïve lungs have reduced granularity, and mutant mice with constitutive low levels of neutrophils displayed permanent protection from ALI.

Trauma repositories are important tools to monitor quality indicators and outcomes in trauma systems, regions and trauma facilities .
The Helsinki University Hospital trauma center is the regional blunt trauma receiving facility in the Southern Finland region.
The Helsinki University Hospital's trauma registry was established in 2005 and has been benchmarked previously against UK trauma facilities.
Estonian regional trauma repositories: a baseline study.
A comparison of case records at the HTR and TTR between 1-1-2015 and 31-12-2016 .
The inclusion criteria for TTR is ISS > 15 and for HTR New Injury Severity Score > 15 of patients treated at the resuscitation room, however, only patients with ISS >15 were included in the current study.
Comparison of injury characteristics, hospital length of stay, intensive care unit stay , TRISS score , 30-day observed and adjusted in-hospital mortality, and standardized mortality ratio .
On-scene RTS was used if the patient was intubated on admission.
Logistic regression analysis was used to compare the adjusted mortality between the regions.
A comparison of HTR and TTR patients for the first time .
Demographics and clinical characteristics of patients admitted to the NEMC .
Non-ground level fall in both trauma systems was predominating mechanism of injury.
Pre-hospital data and ED investigations are depicted in Table 3 .
Interventional radiology was used in 4.6% and 3.7% of the patients at the NEMC and the HUH, respectively .
 HLOS and ICU-LOS was significantly longer at the NEMC, however, ventilator days were similar at the compared systems .
Mortality comparison between trauma systems adjusted for AIS abdomen ≥ 3, non-ground level falls and bicycle injuries .
Standardized mortality ratio was lower at the HUH, however, did not reach statistical significance .
NEMC patients treated at NEMC were discharged home , while HUH were discharged to step-down hospitals .
Estonian trauma system against established Finnish regional trauma system using regional trauma repositories.
Non-ground level falls and GLF contribute to the most of the cases in both regions and similar results have been reported by other European trauma centers.
An independent risk factor for significant injuries was older age, thus, both our study regions are at a "risk group" with a rather high mean age and significant proportion of GLF.
Bicycle injuries are uncommon in the Estonian population and may be affected by a low popularity of bicycles as an everyday transportation vehicle in Estonia compared to Finland.
On-scene care provider of severely injured patients in Estonia is more likely to be a paramedic or physician.
A recent Cochrane Database meta analysis could not find clear benefits of helicopter transportation due to lack of high-quality evidence and heterogeneity.
Utilization of CT-imaging exceeded 90% at both hospitals and may be related to a relatively low number of hemodynamically unstable patients on admission.
 HLOS at the HUH is significantly higher than at the NEMC and the most obvious explanation is significantly more use of step-down hospitals.
 HLOS and ICU-LOS at the NEMC are similar to the DGU registry in Germany .
Estonia needs political will to improve the quality of its education system.
 TRISS score is a widely used tool to monitor the performance of trauma centers, however, due to relatively low number of cases the SMR should be interpreted with caution.
 TRISS methodology is low for traumatic brain injuries and for certain mechanisms of injuries.
Trauma courses to improve outcome of severely injured patients have been recently introduced in both compared trauma systems.
A short study period and a low number of cases, however, as TTR was developed recently, it was not feasible to perform a comparison involving a longer time periods.
Benchmarking trauma repositories at a national level provides opportunities for quality and performance improvements.

Close contact of symptomatic or asymptomatic animals living near Garden Forest Reserve may have been responsible for the contamination of the coatis.
In this paper, I use the word "necessary" a lot, so I'm going to use it a lot.
The coatis were apparently healthy at the time of the sampled, but they were not clinically evaluated at other times; therefore, it was not possible to determine whether clinical signs of CPV-2b infection were demonstrated.
Towards the end of the study, it was found that the state of the asymptomatic carrier state was not critical to the outcome of the analysis.
Only the fecal samples collected in August 2014 were positive for CPV-2b.

Postoperative outcomes for the two groups before and after PSM .
Postoperative ventilation need for mechanical ventilation in the elderly as compared to the nonelderly .
Postoperative mechanical ventilation after PSM, as shown in Table 3 , is statistically similar between the two groups .
A statistically similar number of elderly were admitted to hospital for surgery with the same number of complications.
The use of synthetic mesh in complex cases and those associated with high risk for infection is associated with higher rates of complications such as infections, fistulas and need for explantation .
The elderly population has more chronic conditions, and thus it is expected that this may lead to a higher rate of postoperative morbidity and mortality.
No mesh required explantation and the biological nature of the mesh offers this distinct advantage in highrisk cases.
Post-operative mechanical ventilation in elderly patients is not significantly different from the non-elderly.
Comorbidities and frailty are often interrelated .

Pulmonary surfactant, discovered in the 1950s on to treat and prevent respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants.
Surfactant therapy for low-birth-weight infants.
Pulmonary surfactant is a mixture of 90% lipids and 10% proteins, which in its typical monolayer formation is essential for the function of gas exchange at the fluid −air interface.
Surfactant: A lipid monolayer that decreases surface tension, thus keeping the alveoli open during expansion and contraction phases of the respiratory cycle.
Protein components of surfactant monolayer are transported from the smooth endoplasmic reticulum into multivesicular bodies, they are assembled and stored with the other lipid and protein fractions in lamellar bodies, and then secreted into the alveolar space, forming tubular
SP-A enhances the activity of SP-B and SP-C and preserves the integrity of extensively packed lipid-protein complexes, thus optimizing surfactant performance under particularly demanding physiological conditions.
SP-B and SP-C are essential for spreading and for the physicochemical function of surfactant.

Animal-derived surfactant preparations for neonatal RDS .
Poractant alfa uses liquid chromatography to extract only polar lipids and contains the highest total concentrations of phospholipids and SP-B.
A large retrospective study comparing more than 14,000 infants treated with poractant alfa, beractant or calfactant reported a significantly lower overall mortality for infants with birth weights 500-749 g.
Doses higher than 100 mg/kg of beractant are difficult to administer due to the comparatively low concentration of surfactant in the solution.
A second dose of poractant should be given to infants with ongoing or progressing respiratory distress, when compared to bovine surfactants.
Phospholipids in poractant alfa may be important for optimal efficacy; however, there is a lack of doseequivalent comparison groups to reliably answer this question.

A combination of surfactant therapy and noninvasive respiratory support may be a valuable approach to further improve long-term outcomes.
Very immature infants may benefit less from the noninvasive approach compared to the LISA technique.
Surfactant replacement therapy: from biological basis to current clinical.
ANS together with surfactant reduce mortality, severity of RDS, and air leak of preterm infants.
The timing of surfactant treatment after birth can also impact its efficacy.
Early surfactant treatment combined with primary invasive respiratory support after birth is a good initial strategy for respiratory support.
Meconium aspiration syndrome may be due to ingestion of meconium, 72 blood, 73 milk 74 or bile 75 into the lung.
Surfactant administration of preterm infants triggers inflammation process and release of cytokines and proteases, harbingers of BPD.
Infective mechanical ventilation increases conversion of SA to LA surfactant, which leads to leakage of proteins into the alveolar space and reduces surfACTant function.
A homogenous distribution across the whole compartment of terminal bronchioli and alveoli would be optimal; however, surfactant will not reach areas, which are filled with debris or are collapsed, so a certain distending pressure is required.
A static distending pressure via ventilation bag to re-open the lung and facilitate distribution of surfactant into the periphery.
Increasing FRC after surfactant administration is probably the result of increased FRC, not of altered lung mechanics, so FiO 2 is always the first parameter of ventilation.
Increasing peak inspiratory pressure after surfactant treatment requires a long inspiratory time and relatively long expiratory time, and thus a low frequency, which contrasts to findings from a model of excised rat lungs showing that higher frequencies in the range of 60/min improved homogenous distribution of surf
Intervention by intensification of ventilation: immediate intervention by intensifier of ventilation.
Positive end-expiratory pressure must be high enough to keep alveoli open during expiration, and from the clinical perspective PIP must behigh enough to yield visible chest expansions after surfactant administration.

We found that longer term HD is significantly correlated with an increasing VS incidence .
CABG procedures with CPB in patients with CRF requiring dialysis therapy were an independent risk factor for the development of postoperative VS.
A longer period of dialysis leads to more frequent occurrences of severe vasculitis.
VS is a complication of cardiac surgery that increases mortality and hospital stay.
We showed that chronic HD dependence is a risk factor for VS, and that VS develops more frequently in patients who require longer term HD.
Vasopressin can be used as a first-line vasopressor for post-cardiac surgery VS.
We included major known risk factors in the multivariate analysis to eliminate the influence of more confounding factors.
We consider our criteria to be clinically appropriate for VS, but these timings may have affected VS diagnosis.
Third, our study only assessed chronic HD dependence or non-dependence; thus, we did not assess the direct relationship between CRF and VS.
Longer term chronic HD is associated with a higher incidence of VS after cardiac surgery.

We conducted sensitivity analyses that included an assumption of equal future survival rates between arms.
NIV is cost effective at cost-effectiveness threshold of £20,000 per QALY .
The cost effectiveness of NIV depends on survival rates, future costs, utilities and future QALYs.
The survival rate estimates being in broad agreement with those in published studies , the uncertainty around the long-term cost-effectiveness results should be carefully considered.
The INMB fell by 90% from £10,838 to 603, and the expected probability of long-term cost effectiveness fell to around 79% .
A trial-based economic evaluation showed that NIV has potential to be cost effective compared with invasive weaning.
IMV was the dominant strategy for COPD patients without COPD and those who required surgery.
A lack of difference in the time to liberation from mechanical ventilation does not imply that costs of ICU care beyond this point are no longer relevant for the purposes of cost effectiveness.
A cost-effectiveness analysis of NIV weaning for COPD .
A power calculation for a future trial covering a 5-year follow-up period, using the observed results from this trial, taking into account long-term survival predictions, would require a sample size of at least 215 per group to show with at least 80% power that the INMB would be >
This trial provides useful data to prospectively design a future confirmatory trial with longer follow-up that could demonstrate long-term cost effectiveness.
We found that the NIV protocol has no impact on HRQoL among COPD survivors, and that other factors may need to be considered for optimal weaning approaches.
We have included sensitivity analyses for various parameters while noting that estimated survival rates are broadly similar to those of NIV.
We suggest that long-term outcomes are needed for our estimates to be considered reliable.
Weaning with NIV dominated weaning with invasive ventilation is cost-effective.
The cost of NIV weaning in COPD exacerbations is as low as $25,000.
The Breathe trial was prospectively designed for an economic evaluation using individuallevel data.
We used multiple imputation to replace missing QALY and cost data.
Longer follow-up would have reduced uncertainty surrounding our long-term costeffectiveness estimates.
Early extubation to NIV did not shorten time to liberation from any ventilation.

A mathematical model for cocirculation of Zika and dengue viruses.
We compute our model's BRN only, in which neither infectivity-altering factor appears, since the BRN is defined in terms of the disease-free state.
Infectivities of ADE and coinfected vectors create a complex and asymmetric interplay between dengue and Zika viruses.
We find that Zika will always spread more easily in dengue-endemic regions than it would on its own.
High Zika prevalence impedes the invasion of dengue .
The presence of Zika makes it possible for dengue to persist in a population in which it would not be able to persist by itself.
A mutualistic relationship between Zika and dengue due to ADE.
The impact of ADE on the infectivity of hosts plays a crucial role in dengue-Zika dynamics.

Who should make medical decisions for acutely ill, incapacitated patients?
A recent legal review by Thaddeus Pope highlights the confusing patchwork of laws that various states have passed in order to address this issue.
A state-by-state review of state laws on physician-patient relationships.
PWPs can be avoided if the medical team makes decisions based on the best interest standard.
A list of key points from the second day of the EU summit in Brussels.
A qualitative, retrospective look at the process of decision-making for PWPs.
A PWP who will require imminent, but non-emergent medical decisions, they are advised to contact the ethics consultation service. The consultant first works with the medical team and social worker to conduct an aggressive search for a surrogate, or, failing that, to find someone who knows the patient and
A friend, clergy, or previous health care provider can serve as a surrogate.
An ethics consultant contacts the PWP committee members to recruit 2-3 individuals who can meet with representatives from the medical team within 24-48 h.
PWP committee members synthesize this information, discuss, and make a recommendation that is in the patient's best interest, and consistent with his or her values .
An ethics consultant and social worker searched to find the family of a 72-year-old woman admitted with a severe subarachnoid hemorrhage.
A friend of Ms. M told me that she had no relatives in her native country and that she would not want to extend her life.
The PWP committee met with the NSU team and social worker on two separate occasions and recommended against tracheostomy and PEG placement.
A woman in her 60s was admitted to a nursing facility for comfort care and died 4 h later.
A homeless woman with schizophrenia failed to follow up with an orthopedic appointment, and now required surgery and implanted hardware to repair the ankle.
The medical team believed that she lacked capacity to make this decision, and called ethics.
The PWP committee met with members of the medical team, social work, and psychiatry on day 2 of the hospitalization, and learned that without surgery, it would be impossible for Ms. F to heal and for her to be ambulatory again.
The PWP committee deliberated and agreed with the medical team's recommendation of surgery, casting, and discharge to a nursing facility.
The PWP committee met with the colorectal surgeon, clinical ethicist, and Mr. G to discuss surgery.
An elderly man's wish for surgery is not possible, and the only alternative is ileostomy.
The committee met a second time in the Surgical ICU, after Mr. G had undergone a second emergent surgery, necessitating an ileostomy.
The committee recommended hospice care for Mr. G, who was refusing to eat or get out of bed.
A semi-structured interview of community volunteers for the PWP protocol.
Personal experience in healthcare decision-making • Member's assessment of personal qualifications required for committee membership and preparation for role.
The PWP committee members are intentionally not medical practitioners, and in order to minimize conflict of interest, they cannot be hospital employees.
Experiences of PWP patients and carers.
Membership on the hospital ethics committee is required to gain experience with clinical situations, ethical dilemmas, and sound decision-making processes.
Patience and ability to communicate effectively with laypersons.
Members of the PWP committee serve in place of the laypersons who would, if available, be making decisions for these patients.
Training in ethics and clinical experience is desirable, according to members.
A realistic view of what medicine can and cannot do."
Communication skills, compassion, empathy, and the ability to cope with ambiguity are key for PWP meetings.
Empirical committee members must be able to cope with the doubt and ambivalence inherent in these decisions.
Appreciate ambiguity and live with some uncertainty.
A concern in any type of surrogate decision-making is that one's personal values and biases may cloud judgment and interfere with the best interest of the patients.
Individual values always underlie these kinds of processes, and I know I would want everything done, except if there is irreversible suffering.
I lean towards comfort care- I know I do… I don't think it makes me too quick to shut down other choices.
The lack of information about PWPs likely leads to some projection of committee members' values onto patients.
Family surrogates can predict the patient's wishes with 66-82% accuracy, leaving 18-34% of decisions not in agreement with what the patient would want.
No comment from committee members with religious affiliations about the effect of their beliefs on their decision-making process.
An aunt with advanced dementia, a son-in-law with colon cancer, a patient with real history, regrets, conflicts, love, goals.
PWP committee members felt that these experiences made them more comfortable being direct with the doctors, and gave them a clearer understanding of comfort care and hospice.
The PWP decisionmaking protocol relies on consensus among multiple committee members and the medical team in the hopes that differing perspectives and experiences will neutralize individual biases.
Meeting with the Medical Team: A Survey of Committee Members' Experiences.
The committee members almost universally felt comfortable asking the medical team questions during meetings, but many commented that accessing the necessary information required assertive questioning.
"Wishy-washy" doctors can be Wishy-Washy about the likelihood of success.
Ethics consultants and social worker were helpful in gathering information about patients and guiding the discussion.
Groupthink is a bias that results from a cohesive group trying to reduce the stress of decision-making .
The PWP meetings seem to have the right group size to gain multiple perspectives while minimizing groupthink.
The committee recruited members who already tend to agree with one another and therefore may have absorbed the culture or attitudes of the broader group.
Information on prognosis, quality of life, minimizing suffering, the risks and benefits of proposed interventions, and the patient's wishes if known.
Towards an end-of-life care plan, what are the risks and benefits?
In the absence of social support, PWPs are unable to comply with follow-up and continue to put weight on her ankle despite the medical
The PWP committee is considering how best to involve incapacitated patients in the decision-making process.
Nonprofessionals unused to seeing sick patients may be affected in unpredictable ways, lacking the medical knowledge to contextualize what they are seeing .
We agree that seeing critically ill patients may elicit a strong emotional response from committee members, and that medical professionals are much less likely to react such a way.
In the case of Ms. F, the necessary treatment and prognosis were clear enough that the committee overruled her expressed wish to refuse surgery and wear the boot.
He was unable to explain the bases of his decisions, yet caused some guilt and discomfort when going against them.
The PWP protocol represents a feasible solution to a long-standing problem of who will make decisions for incapacitated patients when there is no surrogate.
Satisfaction: indicates their satisfaction as well as questions about the process.
Ethically defensible decision-making for patients.
An ethicist and social worker can make a reasonable guess as to what the patient would have wanted.
A patient's wish might be to set limits on treatments, or forego them entirely.
Picking up biographical information about a patient does not automatically mean that the patient is in the best interest of the patient.
Who should make medical decisions for patients who lack proxies?
A PWP decision-making process that considers both medical and legal considerations .
We believe shared decision-making is appropriate for patients without surrogates.
We found that the committee members are not demographically representative of the patients for whom they make decisions.
Health literacy and clinical experience in decision-making are more important than traditional surrogates, and a more racially diverse committee could help.
Decision-making based on a patient's wishes is ethically more desirable than "best interest".
We believe that "informed best interest" is best determined by rigorous dialogue between the medical team and committee members.
Our protocol respects the autonomy of patients by mandating a thorough search for suitable surrogates and other evidence of the patient's wishes.
We have a new president, a new constitution, and a new set of laws and regulations.
A more formalized review and debriefing process could be initiated, which would be helpful for quality control and training, as well as a source of closure for the committee members.
Debrief committee members on challenging cases, one-on-one, to protect against burnout.
We have a committee of community members who are empathic and knowledgeable in clinical decision-making, doing their best to represent patients who otherwise have no one to speak for them.
PWP protocols should focus on improving on the status quo by implementing thorough procedures for finding background information about the patient, promoting transparency, and minimizing conflict of interest.

Innovation in Healthcare: A Case Study of Implementation and Implementation .
Invention is hard but dissemination is even harder. Theoretical models of change 7 have identified different primary catalysts for the adoption of innovation.
Risk-Based Framework for Implementation Research in Neonatal Intensive Care Units .
Initial Motive for Change: A Multidisciplinary Perspective.
The use of evidence-based interventions in perinatal care in 19 regions of 11 European countries.
We interviewed two physicians and two nurses with experience of 3 years clinical work in a region within these strata.
Interviews within the study period: interviews within a study period.
The study was approved by the Ethics Committees in all regions, where the Committees waived the requirement.
We carried out 44 semi-structured interviews in local language, focussing on the most recent clinical or organizational innovation introduced in the unit regarding care of very preterm infants .
A guide to the planning, dissemination and implementation phases; compliance and perceived benefits of the innovation.
Interviews with an informant of a terrorist organisation.
We used thematic analysis to identify the patterns across the dataset relevant to the description and motives for change.
E-mail discussions between the interviewers and the Italian team were used to check the interpretation of results.
Saturation is emerging in all NICUs after the first half of the interviews.
The characteristics of NICUs and informants are presented in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.
Nurses are more likely to report care-related motives, while physicians are more sensitive to the availability of new knowledge.
Findings in scientific literature, attendance at conferences and informal opportunities to exchange information with colleagues are reported as main triggers for change.
Stabilisation of premature infants by non-invasive ventilation.
A consultant came from a unit where a different mode of infant ventilation was being used, so we were sort of fairly happy that it was not going to do any harm.
A look at the role of new technology in driving change.
The RAM cannulas for nasal ventilation allow us to use a high flow and apply pressure both during inspiration and expiration.
A new ventilation system in a hospital has been reported, and it's more powerful than the previous system.
An easy-to-use machine that allows us to analyse every time the lipid, protein and carbohydrate content , well we do it, everything is analysed and we will know exactly what we are doing.
We had attended a conference as a team and looked at the equipment, and thought that it would be something really good.
We decided that we were going to buy this, and we went ahead and bought it.
This is an example of a national guideline being applied to a local policy.
We followed the rules and not be outside of bounds.
A paediatric pain group was created, including the various sub-specialties at the level of paediatrics.
No proper protocol was in place, and guidelines issued by official agencies were viewed as more bureaucratic, and less appropriate to the unit patients and care.
NICE guidelines can be quite weak, and the evidence on which the guideline is based is quite weak.
Standardize practices generally arose within the unit team, aiming at more consistent and homogeneous care:
We did know, that you must react, but it wasn't standardized.
A common approach was felt especially in case of rapid staff turnover, or because of new professionals joining the unit:
We have physiotherapists in NICU .
The 23 weekers were only in the mind of God, now they survive, therefore clearly you have to update progressively, as both research and type of patients lead you to adapt some parts.
A structured protocol for kangaroo skin-to-skin maternal care:
In Italy, participation in a project to increase parental presence in NICU led to the establishment of a new routine for the first communication with the parents:
An educational protocol identifying the situations when endotracheal intubation could be performed by trainees:
A new ventilator, a new ventilation strategy, and then you have all the scientific enthusiasm inherent to intensivists.
A lot has happened in the last few days, and I don't know what the future holds.
A change of unit practices and the urgency to prevent similar cases in the future.
We diagnosed a baby who was in hospital with aortic coarctation late.
A suction device that actually didn't work, the device was faulty, and you would have noticed if you had checked it beforehand.
A daily check-in is needed, and it's got to be a daily check.
A hospital nurse on the importance of guidelines for difficult intubation.
Improving care in the first few hours of a baby's life is important.
A look back at the first week of the baby's life.
Parenteral nutrition prevents the babies from entering a catabolic state, which happens when they are born.
A state-of-the-art parenteral bag system was introduced for newborns who were born outside the 24-hour limit.
A baby is born, the baby exists, and the baby only exists after it is born.
We ended up by speeding things a little and planning ahead and making requests for babies, who aren't yet identified with a file number, by using only the mother's identity and the baby's predicted weight.
We introduce kinaesthetics into our care practices.
We wanted to do something good for the children, and we noticed that we treat them differently from medical colleagues.
Breathing improves, no question about that, but you need to give the child a support, some security, so the baby doesn't have the feeling, oh God, what do I do now?
We chose our focal points that we want to communicate to the parents. We really pushed the advice for breastfeeding, reinforced skills in feeding and handling the infants.
An overview of the type of clinical and organizational innovations introduced in the NICUs and of the main factors that motivated the decision to change.
We found that the introduction of innovative policies or treatments in NICUs can be triggered by several factors.
Two views of evidence-based medicine: rigorous identification of scientific evidence with results of randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses only, versus the broader view including other sources of evidence such as different study designs, clinical experience, and "pragmatic science" methods of learning.
We found that the type of motivation to change influenced the ability to change.
Innovations arising within the NICU team, out of personal experiences and exchanges with colleagues, new information from the literature or participation in research, appeared to lead to smoother and possibly quicker implementation.
Glamour and commercial interests foster the adoption of new technologies even before evidence of benefit is established.
Kangaroo care is absolutely necessary, and the active participation of unit staff in the development of the new policy, or at least in the decision to adopt it, appeared crucial to increase compliance.
Generating knowledge but also as learning experience for participants.
An overview of the factors that trigger change and promote the introduction of clinical and organizational innovation in NICUs.
An analysis of innovation in medical and nursing, based on a series of real-world experiences.
A study on the impact of change in the NICU.
Incorporating actual participation in research studies can be an effective way to test innovations before adoption and monitor the outcomes.
 qualitative research can contribute to a better understanding of the circumstances and conditions that foster the development, dissemination and implementation of clinical innovations.

 counselling for women who have experienced relationships characterised by intimate partner violence can have many positive effects.
Exploring options to leave a violent/abusive relationship, considering options to solve problems within the relationship .
A competency framework that focuses on counselling skills, specialist knowledge and specific personal characteristics needed .
How counsellors experience the counselling encounter in regard to IPV is an important aspect of understanding such counselling.
We interviewed counsellors about their understandings of relationships characterised by IPV and how they, as counsellor, worked with IPV in their practice.
South Africa has one of the highest prevalence rates of domestic victimisation in the world .
Women in South Africa face many barriers when reporting IPV, related to resource constraints and social issues.
In terms of social issues, some women may not report abuse due to conservative gender roles; e.g., the belief that the man is the head of the household and that his authority, and manner, which he runs the household, should not be questioned.
IPV has become normalised within relationships, and women may accept such violence as an everyday feature of their intimate relationships.
Women are more likely to feel ashamed about reporting IPV due to the personal, and sometimes sexual, nature of the assault .
IPV is an under-recognized and under-treated condition .
The South African non-governmental organisation sector has played a role in addressing IPV.
Access to counselling for IPV is vital for women and children in South Africa.
From the abuse: from the abuse to the abuse .
A feminist framework for counselling women experiencing IPV, based on feminist principles.
Women have emphasised the need to share their stories with counsellors within a safe and trustworthy environment where there was sufficient time to explore issues .

Benable human experiences to be seen as socially positioned and culturally grounded .
Data collected by means of interviewing counsellors, using Wengraf's method, who were based at two NGOs, one located in an urban and the other in a peri-urban area in the Eastern Cape, South Africa.
Counsellors from the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHCR) are sent to a village in the north-east of the country to help people with mental health problems.
Counselling by 'wounded healers' may be beneficial as the counsellors are able to identify with the clients'
A client-centered, solution-based approach to counselling is adopted.
The study was granted ethical clearance by the Rhodes University Psychology Department's Research Projects and Ethics Review Committee.
A study of the relationship between isiXhosa and English in South Africa.
The first author and a co-researcher together conducted three separate interviews with each of the eight participants, using Wengraf's method.
The researcher asked questions based on topics that had emerged during the first interview, so as to determine which topics are suitable for follow-up questions in the final interview.
Micro-narratives emerge during interviews with counsellors .
Coding centred on the identification of micro-narratives.
We develop good counselling dynamics, we use non-directive counselling, 'when things go well, we feel positive', 'counselling IPV victims is emotional labour', 'we provide moral guidance and suggestions'.
Counsellors used a variety of session management tools in order to create a positive environment and appropriate counsellor-client session relationships/dynamics.
Counsellors praised their clients for coming to see them, as can be seen in the following extracts.
A woman says that 'enough is enough' and she's ready to take any step.
Lwando: ...as for us at once a woman take a step forward, we take you as a survivor person.
In the above extracts, Duvi spoke of attempting to build a positive relationship with her client by Bcongratulat^her for coming to see her, and Lwando by Bsee that as a survivor^.
A story of bondage and then of deliverance provided a positive framing that counsellors encouraged in the session.
Counsellors acknowledged that the movement from victim to survivor requires counselling labour. Some of the counsellors mentioned a space to listen empathetically and attentively to their clients as an important counselling management tool.
A micro-narrative of non-directive counselling.
Talk about it so that you are also getting the answers.
Amandisa Nkosi takes up the position of Beducator^in relation to her clients, narrating how she informs them of their rights and the options open to them.
Counsellors in the institutional 'space of helping' may reinforce their narrative of bondage/deliverance of which they see themselves as facilitators.
A counsellor presents a client with a set of options, and the client has to decide whether or not to take them.
Amandisa gives Badvice because telling clients what to do is viewed as problematic.
Counsellors spoke of positive experiences when reflecting on successful outcomes.
Lwando: Women becoming brave to report these cases that makes me very happy.
Lwando expresses happiness at women being 'brave' and reporting cases as well as the outcome of a perpetrator being sentenced in court.
In these circumstances that the counsellors experience positive emotions and feel that they are successful in their work.
A clear micro-narrative that emerged in the interviews concerned the emotional labour that goes into providing counselling for IPV clients.
I got angry when a woman is staying in an abusive relationship.
Shelly's struggle to remain objective can be seen in her revealing that she felt angry when her clients chose not to leave relationships characterised by IPV.
Shelly, as the wounded healer, managed, eventually, to accomplish the situation most desired by the woman in this case.
Counsellorsthat women leave abusive relationships, and thus experiences the countertransference of anger when this does not occur.
Empirical interviews with counsellors on the effects of stress.
Nomsa: We still have the supervision … so each week we bring … all those worrying cases /mmm/ and also we … get … advices from the other colleagues /okay/ …we … present your case and all other colleagues will intervene.
Amanda: I have in the past organised consultations with a private person or someone to deal with that .
Nomsa and Amanda discuss the Bworry^, providing input and advice, and suggested that the counsellors take on the burden of their clients' IPV experiences by feeling empathy for them.
An NGO for professional supervision: NGO forprofessional supervision.
Non-directive counselling with moral guidance and suggestions.
Mrs. X is attempting to reassure her client that the pregnancy is temporary and that her client must Btake better care of self.
Self-care is the sole responsibility of the woman; failure to engage in self-care results in the woman being positioned as wilfully refusing to prevent damage.
In this paper, we provide moral guidance, and then we use that guidance to improve our own lives.
The micro-narratives the counsellors related of their experiences of counselling women in IPV relationships, and the associated subject positions, point to a number of conundrums or double binds.
Counsellor dismay at the lack of 'success' .
A man left a woman he was having an affair with, and the woman remained within the relationship.
Counsellors used non-directive counselling, informing women of their rights and options and assisting them in making decisions.
Female counsellors invested in a narrative of female survivorhood, that implied leaving violent intimate relationships, is perhaps not surprising, given the high rates of abuse in the country.
We argue that the conundrums evident in the counsellors' talk stem from the fact that they counsel the women within already entrenched patriarchal and structural power relations.
A 'narrow' view of counselling outcomes may, therefore, be more likely to fail than not.
Counsellors felt overwhelmed, fatigued and disappointed if their clients did not leave the IPV relationship.
Counsellors should see their clients as complex beings: somewhere between victim and survivor, slipping between the two depending on circumstances.
In the first place, because they feel hopeful that they can receive some assistance; valuing women having a comfortable space to share their stories to gain some insight; and the notion of women engaging in everyday practices that serve to increase their agency and reduce the IPV.
The narrative of bondage and delivery needs to be nuanced to allow for other narratives of success, including changing dynamics within the household or simple mechanisms to reduce the possibility of abuse.
Social empowerment initiatives aim to alter and/ or develop troubling dynamics within relationships to reduce IPV.
Thirdly, recognising that counsellors and clients are both steeped in patriarchal power relations that, in the first place, foster IPV and, in second place, make resolving the situation very difficult is important.
Adversarial interventions can help counsellors feel less burnt-out and despondent about their work.
Training and Clinical Supervision for Wounded Healers .

On POD1 a ΔPCO 2 ≥ 6 mmHg was reported at least once in all patients.
An elevated ΔPCO 2 did not predict prolonged ICU and hospital stays .
The algorithm combining ΔPCO 2 with ERO 2 and lactate identified 12 patients with a low- risk profile and 13 patients with high-risk profile at the time of admission.
The high-risk group at the time of admission had ICU LOS twice as long as the low risk group.
The ICU LOS was not significantly different across patients with low or elevated lactate days, respectively, at the time of admission.
High ΔPCO 2 on admission and on POD1 of conventional cardiac surgery was found to be very frequent and did not predict an elevated ΔPCo 2 at T6, T12 or T24.
Elevated ΔPCO 2 alone did not predict a prolonged ICU stay.

A small sample size, but a significant decrease in ProQoL's burnout was demonstrated post-intervention.
A small sample size and poor response rate post-intervention improved staff wellbeing, but the reduction in ProQoL's burnout does suggest that this intervention may be of benefit.
We can conclude that BRecognise and Reflect^sessions are not feasible for long-term implementation.
A team bonding session was held, despite repeated efforts to organize subsequent sessions.
BRecognise and Reflect^sessions were discontinued, the feedback demonstrated that they were mostly viewed as a positive experience.
A small sample size and poor response rate post-intervention significantly limits the ability to conclude on improvements in wellbeing.
Sensitive questions in the survey may have contributed to the lower response rate post-intervention.
Post-intervention follow-up would not contribute to this study.
This study is subject to responder bias, and the positive feedback on the intervention may not be representative of the views of all the midwives working in the labour ward.
We cannot conclude that the improvement in burnout was due to the intervention and not due to a confounding factor.
Burnout, compassion fatigue, and perceived stress we identified in our cohort.
Low participation in BRecognise and Reflect^and team bonding sessions are not feasibly long term in CUMH, but these sessions received positive feedback and showed a significant reduction in burnout.
In a modified format, these sessions may have the potential to improve staff wellbeing in other units.

GIK infusion increases LVEF as much as moderate doses of dobutamine while avoiding tachyarrhythmias and arterial hypotension .
Insulin for Cardiac Performance and Cardioprotective Effects .
In GIK treated hearts, the increased glucose uptake coupled with decreased free fatty acid uptake, results in a shift from FFA to glucose aerobic metabolism and more efficient oxygen utilization.
Weaning from CPB and compared with pre-bypass conditions, the Placebo group exhibited a significant decline in LV systolic and diastolic function that required the administration of inotropes in two-third of patients.
In GIK pretreated patients, echocardiographic markers of LV systolic function were well preserved compared with preoperative baseline.
GIK infusion promotes a fed-liked state by altering gene expression and enzymes activities resulting in enhanced glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis .
GIK infusion improves the LV function and reduces the RV risk.
Need for Inotropes did not translate into reduced postoperative cardiac mortality and morbidity, except for easier weaning from the ventilator consequent to improved LV function.
Adding GIK therapy to standard cardioprotective techniques in moderate-to-high risk patients with ischemic heart disease resulted in better preservation of LV systolic and diastolic function in the early period following from cardiopulmonary bypass.

Simulation experiments for AMP CoR study.
We describe notations and methods in the context of the AMP trials, but these can be generalized to other applicable biomedical settings with repeated drug administrations.
Let t s be the time since the most recent infusion when drug concentration reaches the zeroprotection threshold, s.
We define the time-varying covariate as time since the most recent infusion or t s in a cyclic and piecewise manner:
We consider z as a proxy of the drug concentration at time t because after each infusion, drug concentrations are expected to change in a monotonic fashion.
Log-linear relationship with time for drug concentrations that follow a one-compartment pharmacokinetics model with a single decay rate .
Time-varying covariate in zero-protection model improves performance.
An average of t s can be used in the actual simulation of survival times.
In the AMP trials, the minimum survival time is 81 days in the low- and high-dose groups.
Under the zero-protection threshold model, the instantaneous hazard at t s within each cycle is assumed to be
The hazard rate in the control group where no association of the drug with survival is expected to be observed.
The Cox model is formulated through the hazard function. Therefore, the simulation of appropriate survival times for this model needs further manipulation based on the relationship between the hazardfunction and the covariate as discussed in .
A survival time can be generated by inverting the cumulative hazard function.
We extend the work of Austin to accommodate both timeinvariant covariates, x, and a continuous time-varying covariate, z.
The single-dose approach considers simulating survival data over one-dose interval as a first step before multiple-dose intervals.
We show derivations in details for Cox models with an exponential baseline hazard.

The single-dose approach is used to simulate survival data for 1000 AMP-like trials. Within each trial, a time-varying covariate is associated with the survival outcome.
HIV infection rate beyond t s in the two dose groups.
We consider two study adherence levels: the high and medium adherence scenarios assume the probability of missing a given infusion is 2% and 10% for each of the 10 infusions, and are simulated based on random draws from binomial distributions.
Low-dose group should have higher risk of infection than high-dosage group because drug concentrations in the former group on average are expected to reach the zero-protection threshold in a shorter time.
Better study adherence due to less missed infusions and less follow-up time .
In the second experiment, the multiple-dose approach is used to simulate AMPlike trials under perfect study adherence scenarios with = 0 and h 0 = daily HIV incidence rate divided by exp .

We explore the model for stochastically proportional availability and propose a newsvendor model with dependent random availability and demand.
The optimality condition of our problem would be different than the presented one in Okyay et al.
Constraint imposes budget constraint on the total money invested for demand and availability increasing strategies.
Primary approach for solving bilevel optimization problems is replacing lower level problem by its first order conditions.
The newsvendor should be able to manufacture its own products under the following conditions:
Condition guarantees that the average revenue is higher than the unit production cost, whereas condition ensures that the unitProduction cost is greater than the average salvage value.
Is strictly concave in Q for every B d and B y . This assures that the solution to the lower level problem is unique.
In this formulation, the central authority optimizes utility/social welfare subject to her constraints and optimal decision of manufacturer.
We use lognormal distribution to represent demand and availability as various distributional shapes can be represented by it.
We assume that demand comes from a lognormal distributions with parameter B d . Once B d is set, the demand distribution will be known accordingly.
An increase in B d will not increase the cv D value.
We construct the availability function with a similar reasoning as in demand function.
An increasing concave function in B y and takes values in the interval .
First order stochastic dominance order holds for the availability model as in demand case.
We assume that demand and availability can be jointly lognormally distributed.
A stochastic dominance order between B d or B y leads to an increase in the investment amount allocated to demand increasing strategies in our model.
We use the mean demand function analyzed in Khouja and Robbins , which is given below:
Designing intervention scheme for vaccine market: a bilevel where is the initial mean demand and w and are constants that reflect effectiveness of demand increasing strategy.
As B y → 0, H Y → 1 a and as B Y → ∞, HY → 1 .

We use the expected sales value to assess the utility for this problem.
The effect of the budget size in Sect. 5.2.4.
We state the below proposition using the fact that expected sales is an increasing function of Q.
Proposition 1 Consider all the conditions stated by Remark 1, Remarks 2 and 3 are satisfied, so that Q is an increasing function of both B d and B y .
In this paper, we express the problem in terms of a single variable.
We observe that the objective function is concave with respect to B y .
We compare a given intervention design with its expected sales, and compare its value with the former one.
We consider this situation as one would see such cases in practice.
E] replacing the random availability variable will be either an over or under-estimate of the expected sales value.

We choose the cost parameters and availability information from prior related studies in the literature, the details can be found in Table 2 .
We think that the key parameters to calibrate are and , both describing the shape of the demand function.
We use only one value for w, as we think that the calibration procedure will adjust the results obtained for the demand function.
In this paper, we present the results of a series of experiments on the effect of a small amount of water on the brain.
We use the numerical results obtained as a basis to demonstrate the improvements that can be obtained by applying the proposed joint mechanism.
Change in budget level corresponds to a completely different problem environment due to change in demand model's parameter calibration process.
We analyze the vaccination percentage to be reached if joint mechanism is applied under the budget amount of 158.992 million.
Improving Vaccination Rates under Budget-Based Strategy .
We observe that unless total budget is very tight, higher uncertainty in the system and negative correlation between demand and availability raise vaccination percentages even more with efficient allocation of budget among intervention alternatives.
We determine the budget required to achieve the aforementioned vaccination percentage with the joint mechanism, and demonstrate the savings in the required budget.
Even the availability improving strategy's efficiency is tenfold lower.
We examine the influence of an imperfect availability without uncertainty on the vaccination percentage.

A task force on transfusion in non-bleeding critically ill adults.
A guideline for blood product transfusions and transfusion prevention in non-bleeding critically ill adults .
Most clinical trials evaluating transfusion thresholds have identified the "restrictive" arm as being the intervention which needs to demonstrate benefit or equivalence compared to a more liberal transfusion threshold.
This guideline provides advice on general transfusion strategies for non-bleeding adult ICU patients, but specific patient characteristics and circumstances will require the application of a personalized approach.
The task force included 13 stakeholders with expertise in critical care medicine, anaesthesiology, haematology, cardiac surgery, and transfusion medicine along with three methodologists experienced in guideline development.
Information regarding patient values and preferences for transfusion and transfusion outcomes was obtained via literature review.

Evidence from observational data could be rated upwards if effect sizes were large, there was evidence of a dose-response gradient, or all plausible confounding would either reduce a demonstrated effect or suggest a spurious effect.
We crossed thresholds relevant to decision-making. We applied judgements of effect sizes consistently.
An evidence-based recommendation for PICO-based decision framework .
A strong recommendation indicates that the vast majority of patients would desire the given recommendation, and in general, a clinician would need a compelling reason to not follow such a recommendation.
Subpopulations of the guideline, clinicians will need to judge which evidence is most pertinent to the individual patient and judge which recommendation is most appropriate.
The task force generated 16 clinical practice recommendations and identified five PICOs with insufficient evidence to make any recommendation.
We recommend a restrictive transfusion threshold for general ICU population, with or without ARDS .
A restrictive transfusion strategy does not increase long-term mortality and most other critical outcomes may be either reduced or unchanged.
A general ICU population, with practice variability seen primarily in specific subgroups described elsewhere .
In the absence of clear evidence suggesting a differing effect of restrictive transfusion in ICU patients with ARDS, we extended this recommendation to patients with the condition.
We recommend that a restrictive transfusion strategy using a transfusion trigger of 7 g/dL should be implemented for most patients.

Preferences, an alternative transfusion trigger could be used.
We recommend a restrictive transfusion threshold for critically ill adults undergoing cardiac surgery .
A restrictive transfusion strategy has no effect on quality of life at 3 months, measured using EQ-5D.
Restrictive thresholds may result in a small increase in ARDS, though the certainty of these effects is low.
The effects of restrictive versus liberal transfusion strategies in cardiac surgery patients are small, with absolute risk differences of less than 1% for critical outcomes of mortality and quality of life.
A restrictive transfusion strategy results in a reduction in the use of blood products and a lower mean number of transfusions .
We define a restrictive transfusion threshold as 7.5 g/dL, being used in the two largest trials.
We do not make a recommendation for a restrictive vs. a liberal transfusion threshold in critically ill adults with acute neurologic injury .
The effect of restrictive transfusion upon mortality stroke in patients with acute neurologic injury is uncertain.
In this paper, we found that transfusion thresholds are inconsistent, and that the point estimates of restrictive transfusion upon mortality suggest harm, but also result in a small improvement in functional recovery.
We considered the potentially significant effects upon critical patient outcomes could outweigh the resource considerations in this population.
The panel made no recommendation, judging that the wide variability in transfusion practice in this population, using either 7 g/dL or 9-11.5g/dL, is consistent with the current lack of evidence.
An approach targeting a haemoglobin value of 10 g/dL is more consistent with current liberal practices in this population .
We do not make a recommendation for a restrictive vs. a liberal transfusion threshold in critically ill adults undergoing veno-venous or venoarterial ECMO.
We did not identify any RCTs or observational data evaluating alternative transfusion thresholds that are suitable for meta-analysis.

We do not make a recommendation for a restrictive transfusion threshold vs. a liberal threshold in critically ill elderly patients.
An RCT evaluated restrictive vs. liberal transfusion strategies in "elderly" patients .
We identified no data or studies evaluating on transfusion thresholds in extremely elderly critically ill patients.
The TF did not reach consensus on the age at which a patient should be considered "very elderly" and the other guideline recommendations should no longer apply.
In the absence of a clear cutoff age for the "very elderly", the general ICU transfusion recommendations should apply.
Almost 90% of clinicians use physiological transfusion triggers in the ICU under some circumstances .
Only one RCT prospectively compared the use of physiologic transfusion triggers to traditional haemoglobin/haematocrit-based approaches.
InSpectra tissue monitor reduces transfusion rates without a difference in other outcomes .
Evidence summaries for PICOs 1-10 include many RCTs evaluating the effects of alternative haemoglobin and haematocrit triggers upon a variety of patient-important clinical outcomes.
We suggest using haemoglobin and haematocrit-based transfusion thresholds rather than alternative transfusion triggers in non-bleeding, critically ill adults.
Clinical findings suggesting bleeding are reasonable indications to transfuse if bleeding is suspected-in the absence of suspected bleeding, these findings should not be used as transfusion triggers and haemoglobin/ haematocrit triggers should generally be used.
In non-bleeding critically patients, RBC transfusion triggers should be implemented rather than using physiological parameters for transfusion threshold.
Iron therapy in critically ill anaemic patients has little to no effect on mortality or hospital-acquired infections .
Iron therapy has little or no difference between desirable and undesirable effects and uncertainty in the precision of any effects.

 EPO in trauma is driven by the trauma subgroup, and is not seen in the non-trauma population.
EPO is cost effective with a willingness-to-pay $50 k per QALY.
In this paper, I use the word "effective" a lot, so I'm going to use that word a lot in this paper.
EPO is unlikely to be cost effective and would require a widespread practice change in many institutions; the panel did not judge the existing evidence as sufficiently compelling.
In critically ill patients, given the lack of signal for harm, some clinicians and ICUs may reasonably choose to adopt EPO, if sufficient resources exist for implementation.
We do not recommend implementing EPO as standard care for patients with anaemia admitted to the ICU; however, in select patients for whom transfusion avoidance is highly important , the use of EPO could be considered.
We suggest against the routine use of a combination of EPO and iron in critically ill patients with anaemia .
Combining EPO and iron may not improve mortality .
In this paper, I propose a new method for using the data from the GANs to improve the performance of a number of existing GAN schemes.
 EPO or iron therapy for other conditions is at the clinician's discretion as there is no specific guidance.
Iatrogenic anaemia is a common problem in ICUs, where patients may lose an average of 41 mL blood/day, roughly 1 unit/week .
Small-volume blood collection tubes may result in a reduced daily volume of blood loss , and need for blood transfusion .
Small draw Vacutainer-brand tubes are the same size and cost the same as regular blood draw tubes.
Small-volume blood draw tubes improve equity by providing blood-conserving treatment to all critically ill patients.
Small-volume blood collection tubes in critically ill patients may be challenging, for several reasons, including: need to train staff to draw reduced volumes using less vacuum; need to redraw blood from the patients if insufficient sampling and small blood volumes may provide less opportunity to store blood for future testing.
A conditional recommendation on small-draw tubes for blood analysis .
We identified eight RCTs which evaluated blood conservation devices, six with arterial lines , and one with PICC lines .
Using arterial catheter for blood sampling in the ICU may be minimized using alternative sampling techniques such as blood collection systems.
The TF judged that reducing blood loss would likely result in fewer transfusions and the devices may in fact be cost effective.
We recommend continued use of these devices in ICUs where the devices are already used, and continued non-use in those where they are not available.

A method for external validation of a prediction model's performance prior to clinical implementation.
We used an independent population-based cohort to perform a validation study on a previously published ICU mortality prediction model.
We used data from the Ontario CCIS, a web-based data application that uses a combination of methods to capture data.
Level 3 ICU admissions between July 1 2015 and December 31 2016 .
The minimum effective sample size for external validation has been reported as 100 outcome events.
We excluded hospital admissions where patient age was reported as 18 yr or , or where duplicate MODS and/or NEMS entries were reported.
Complete case analyses were used to assess model performance.
We modified our previously published model 12 by excluding the Charlson Comorbidity Index.
The relatedness of the development and validation data sets was reviewed using two approaches.

A comparison of development and other diagnosis for patients admitted to intensive care units in Quebec.
Workload, readmission, and ICU mortality.
Evaluation of ICU subtype group relatedness to development sample .
Missing data were considered to be missing completely at random.
Calibration-in-the-large represents overall calibration of the model.
Models resulting in calibration-in-the-large values that are essentially 0.
The calibration plots in Figs 2a and 2b show that some over-prediction remains following intercept recalibration.
The calibration slope reflects whether the predicted risks are scaled appropriately to each other over the complete range of predicted probabilities.
The unit data set has a calibration slope significantly above 1 indicating too little variation in the predicted risks.
Discrimination for all CCIS data and the individual ICU subtype groups ranged from acceptable to very good ( Table 3).
We found that an intercept update was required, which greatly improved the calibration-in-thelarge for the entire cohort as well as for all ICU subtype groups.
Robust Prognostic Models for Mortality .
AUC compares favourably with Sequential Organ Failure Assessment and Logistic Organ Dysfunction Score.
The development model showed strong agreement between observed and expected mortality as assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test.

Benchmarking is an approach to identify and implement best practices.
The average of the entire cohort, including subgroups or individual ICU results.
We believe that models such as these should be used to monitor performance over time only within individual ICUs.
The TRIPOD framework indicates that a model's predictive performance should be evaluated in relation to subgroups of interest, such as age or sex, specific settings or population rather than just across all individuals combined, which can mask any deficiencies in the model.
NEMS assesses ICU resource utilization and efficiency that has been validated as a nurse workload measure.
Limitations of this study include our inability to adjust for chronic health status as these data are not captured in the CCIS.
We could not evaluate the burn ICU subtype group accurately because of the low number of deaths.
Our ICU mortality prediction model performs well and shows both reproducibility and transportability.
We recommend it should not be used for simple comparisons between ICUs or ICU subtypes.

Why do some HIV-infected individuals generate neutralizing antibody breadth, while others do not?
Cell repertoire formation and selection for bNAb-like antibodies .
HIV variants in the patient, could also lead to systematic differences in neutralizing antibody breadth between patients.
HIV-infected individuals show significant perturbations of their antibody repertoires, including suppressed average SHM frequencies and increased frequencies of B cells expressing antibodies with features associated with autoreactivity.
NoNAb subjects select against antibody lineages with long CDR-H3 and high SHM frequencies.
An unrelated chronic viral infection, human cytomegalovirus, shows no evidence of eliciting the IGH repertoire deviations seen in bNAb HIV-infected individuals.
We first evaluated SHM frequencies in IGH repertoires, to assess the effects of HIV infection, as well as to test for differences between bNAb and noNAb individuals.
IgG subtypes of bNAb individuals are more mutated than those of uninfected people .
The antibody clonal lineages at the 99th percentile of mutation or higher, represent an average of 790 distinct clones in each bNAb individual, rather than small numbers of outlier clones.
IgA antibodies behave differently from the other isotypes, having increased indel rates in HIV-infected individuals compared to uninfected individuals.
Processes compared to the other antibody repertoires of patients with HIV infection.
We found that IgG subtype antibodies in both bNAb and noNAb individuals have longer CDR-H3s compared to uninfected individuals.
Long CDR-H3s and high SHM in bNAb IgG repertoires .
BNAb producers are distinct from noNAb individuals in the selection or persistence of B cells expressing antibodies with long CDR-H3 regions, particularly when these are highly somatically mutated.
The data suggest that bNAb producers respond differently to their immunological environment and achieve very high SHM frequencies in numerous clones despite having lower CD4 + T cell frequencies.

Manga is divided into gender-based and age-based genres.
Gender-/age-based heterosexual marketing genres still firmly shape the styles and aesthetic of manga.
Stereotypical gendering may also occur on the creator's side, as manga authors tend to draw for audiences of their own gender.
Manga offers an escape into an imaginative realm to pursue their desires and aspirations beyond the limitations of societal norms.
A novel that allows readers to "experience different types of the "I" and "relate to the world"

Self-injury in manga is used as a coping strategy rather than an act of suicide.
Finding indicates that while the depiction of wrist-cutting as a coping mechanism to endure "the pain of living" may still evoke a traditional cultural reading that connects the act with suicidal intent.
Self-injury is a resistance against repressive parental domination, similar to Bareiss's analysis of films featuring self-injuring girls.
We observed two contrasting perspectives toward young girls who selfinjure.
Group membership reflects the female characters' desire for escaping from parental control and belonging instead to a group of peers who accept them.
On the other hand, seinen manga aimed at adult male readers portray girls who self-injure from the perspective of male protagonists.
A trope in literature that involves young, attractive, and helpless mistresses waiting to be rescued by a hero.

Quality assessment of LISA procedures with good and with inadequate technical quality .
Quality of LISA procedures: heart rate and oxygen saturation increase compared with baseline and at different time points.
A brief period of bradycardia in the first 10 min after start of LISA procedure.
Success versus failure of the first attempt and between good versus inadequate technical quality.
In whom the first attempt failed the deepest drop in oxygen saturation occurs at median of 2 min.
Oxygen desaturations below 80% occurred in 13/19 of patients with good quality conditions and in 7/15 of those with inacceptable quality .
LISA performed in awake patients had a low success rate of the first attempt, and the technical quality frequently was inadequate.
Using sedative premedication for intubation during LISA.
Propofol as premedication for LISA has shown to increase the need for noninvasive intermittent positive pressure ventilation.
Ketamine as premedication led to a relatively high need for endotracheal intubation.
Oxygen desaturations occur in the first 10 min from start of LISA in premedicated patients.
The increase in heart rate found in our study is at least partly due to the administration of atropine prior to LISA and is therefore no clear indicator of patient stress and discomfort.
One laryngoscopy episode was needed for completion of the procedure.
A comparison of awake LISA with sedative premedication prior to LISA shows that success rates and effects on vital parameters are comparable.
Sedative premedication does not hamper LISA success.
Premedication, operator level of experience and number of attempts needed are important factors increasing the odds for endotracheal intubation related adverse events.
Technical quality because of missing registration forms led to the exclusion of almost 25% of patients that underwent LISA in our study.
We found a significant increase in heart rate at all time points after start op LISA, but this is most probably due to the administration of atropine prior to LISA.
We found no influence of gestational and postnatal age on the success rate and technical quality of awake LISA.
Limitations are the lack of blood pressure data, which could have helped make a distinction between atropine effect and stress in patients with a significant elevation of heart rate.
Heart rate and oxygen saturation in relation to the success rate and quality of intubation.
A study of LISA procedures performed without sedative premedication, the success rate of the first attempt was only 52%, the technical quality was frequently inadequate, and there was a high incidence of oxygen desaturations.
The use of sedative premedication should be strongly considered, regardless of the use of a sedative.

Brain death is legally accepted as the criterion of death in many countries worldwide.
Brain death is an "unacknowledged legal fiction" that is used without full recognition of its falsity .
An alternative criterion of death for organ transplantation.
Can be procured only from donors who are dead.
Decision of death is a metaphysical and ethical choice, a decision that usually depends on the extent to which particular medical facts matter to people.
There must be a default position on death in cases where patients have not made their view on death clear while competent, so that doctors and others how to proceed in such cases.
Proposed policies that diverge less from popular preferences have a better chance of being successfully implemented as policies and the nature of these preferences is an empirical matter.
A recent literature review indicates that the existing data on public attitudes regarding brain death and organ transplantation reflect substantial public confusion about medical and legal facts.

In this paper, Grissom and Kim explore the relationship between relative scores and self-esteem.
 115 participants were removed since they chose "I would not agree to organ donation" as an answer to at least one transplantation question .
Top 3 most frequently chosen stages were 3, 4, and 5, with 4 being the most frequent .
We found that people are more willing to choose a later stage for harvesting a relative's organs than their own.
Organ procurement for transplantation for themselves than for their relatives.
An earlier stage for the relatives than for themselves.
No difference in relative case between time of death determination and time of organ procurement.
There were no notable demographic effects on preferences and gender, religiosity and age.
All three candidate criteria for death determination seem to have some support in our sample.
The preferences are a good guide to which options should be in the choiceset while formulating a policy.
An interesting finding of the study is that participants tended to choose earlier stage in the process of dying for thedetermination of their own death than for the determination of death of their relative.
In terms of weight, they're a bit lighter than they used to be, but they're not as light as they were.
Organ procurement from a dying/dead relative is more likely to come at a later stage than she herself would prefer.
A large majority of people prefer organs to be taken at the same stage at which death is declared or at a later stage.
Limitations of this study include the fact that participants were self-selected which prohibits us from drawing inferences about distribution of preferences in the whole Latvian population.
A sequential description of the process of dying and an acceptable time for organ procurement that study participants are willing to apply.
We propose an ordinal scale, which we use for explanation, simplicity and intuitiveness.
Empirical data from Latvia on preferences concerning death determination criteria.
We provide some preliminary evidence that-if default option is needed at all-this criterion would be most practicable as the default option.
A person's relatives can choose the death determination criterion that is best for the person.
We think that our findings provide some initial evidence to support the pluralistic solution proposed by Veatch.

Gastric decompression can prevent life-threatening gastric rupture, but it may cause further ventilatory instability by providing a low-pressure leak via a "bronchocutaneous" fisula, with resultant ineffective ventilation .
Sp spontaneous ventilation is preferred during the induction of general anesthesia in this patient population.
Bag-mask ventilation can be achieved without gastric distention first.
In the case of endobronchial, one-lung ventilation, the endotracheal tube is positioned in the right or left main stem bronchus until the fistula is ligated surgically, then withdrawn into the trachea for the remainder of the procedure.
An endotracheal tube without a Murphy eye and positioning of the bevel to face anteriorly will maximize occlusion of the fistula.

Using invasive monitoring devices with severe head injuries reduces survival by up to 50%.
A number of adult studies showing a modest reduction in mortality with placement of invasive ICP monitors , while a number that demonstrate either no difference or worse survival .
ICP monitoring is associated with a significant reduction in mortality but only for those children with a GCS of 3 . This led us to hypothesize that there may be a subset of patients in the TQIP database who similarly benefited.
A GCS of 5-6 increases the risk of mortality in children with intraventricular drain .
Interventions for intracranial hypertension can change the outcome compared with a more middling severe TBI group.
A study looking at high-dose barbiturates for refractory intracranial hypertension in pediatric patients showed better long-term outcomes when ICPs were controlled compared to uncontrolled, but this finding does not translate to monitoring having a benefit.
Intraparenchymal ICP monitors and cerebral perfusion pressures that limit the utility of monitors.
We stratify risk by invasive monitor type, which is not previously done in the pediatric literature and has been conflicting in adult literature .
The TQIP database only includes those children that are admitted and does not account for non-TQIP centers.
Institutional protocols for placement of ICP monitor and management of intracranial hypertension, actual ICP/CPP measurements, timing of invasive monitor placement, and other potentially prognostic variables .
Lack of imaging data is a significant limitation of this database, because TQIP only provides index hospitalization data.
Incorporating invasive ICP monitors in pediatric patients with severe TBI may actually be associated with increased mortality in certain pediatric populations.
In this paper, we propose a new method for performing surgery that can be used to improve the quality of life of patients.

Risk estimates for ICU transfer using goodness-of-fit and feature selection .
Early ICU transfer increases the risk of an inpatient admission to three times the average.
The risk model is well calibrated in the middle 80% of predicted risk, overestimates risk for high risk patients, and underestimating risk for low risk patients.
The AUC of the risk marker using cross-validated risk estimates was 0.697 .
The risk marker model requires fewer than one third the number of alerts to achieve a sensitivity of 10%.
Predicting which patients are at risk for wardto-ICU transfer at the time of admission .

A real-time prediction of patient risk based on vital sign and laboratory information.
High-risk patients in the ED can prompt direction admission to the ICU, and could reduce early ICU transfer and the associated poorer outcomes.
This study is limited in that the model was developed and tested at a single center. Models may need to be tuned for a specific population or with different clinical protocols.
We believe the presence of meaningful markers of deterioration in the event population serves as an effective proxy for appropriateness of ICU transfer.
Predictive analytic monitoring based on ED data can help identify patients that will require upgrade to ICU or IMU if admitted to acute care.

Large pharmaceutical companies abandoned antibacterial drug discovery in the 1980s.
In this Review, we analyse the preclinical antibacterial pipeline and provide a current snapshot and decision support.
We grouped antibacterial projects that met these criteria into the following categories: direct-acting traditional agents ; antibacterial vaccines, antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates; phages or phage-derived proteins and microbiota-modulating therapies.
We looked at the type and location of institutions carrying Lead generation phase Drug discovery phase where promising molecules are evaluated and undergo limited optimization to identify suitable lead compounds.
The preclinical antibacterial pipeline consists of 407 highly diverse projects from 314 institutions.
More than three hundred and fourteen research and development institutions working on antibacterial programmes that met our inclusion criteria.
SMEs with fewer than 50 employees are most likely to develop antibacterial drugs.
SMEs focus on antibacterial research and development, mostly based on one specific technology.
Large pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, non-profit research institutions and public-private partnerships were excluded from this study.
Preclinical antibacterial research and development is dominated by SMEs, with few employees and dependence on one programme or technology.
Private funding in antibacterial research and development is relatively modest and threatens the stability of the early pipeline.
We identified 407 preclinical projects, 81% are SMEs and 4% are larger companies, and they fall into seven broad categories.

An Overview of Management of NK Cell Deficiency .
A management perspective on the diagnosis and management of NKD.
This is a brief summary of my experience in the field of cancer treatment and its impact.
An assessment of NK cell function using a biological assay to measure NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity.
A perspective on the management of patients diagnosed with NKD.
The innate lymphoid cell lineage is sustained through evolution for a variety of reasons .
NK cells do not rearrange their germline DNA to gain specificity and inherently carry all relevant receptor sequences needed to exert function.
KIR receptors recognize a variety of signatures of disease or cell stress and exist in balance with a relatively large family of inhibitory receptors capable of repressing NK cell functions.
T cells existed to recognize "altered self," specifically MHC molecules presenting foreign peptides, and that NK cells were there to engage in circumstances where "self" was not present .
Molecules encoded in their genome to specifically try to inhibit and evade NK cells .
NK cell cytotoxicity is an end unto itself in being able to contribute to other aspects of an immune response.
Cytotoxicity is a cellular process in which highly specialized organelles, called lytic granules, are organized and polarized towards a triggering diseased cell .
Having NK cells that are disabled in cytotoxicity but fully functional in producing cytokines contributes to the primary immunodeficiency hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in a subset of HLH syndromes.
With impairment of NK cell cytotoxicity is typically caused by defective dampening of inflammation from dysfunction in regulatory components of the inflammasome .
NK cells develop from hematopoietic precursors in the bone marrow and go through a number of peripheral and central stages of maturation to become the cytotoxicityenabled mature NK cell.
Severe Combined Immunodeficiency caused by aberration of IL2RG gene that prevents appropriate expression of the IL-2 receptor common gamma chain .
PIDs with an NK cell abnormality but other defective components of immunity lead to the primary clinical manifestation.
A review of the role of NK cells in human health .
NKD is a subset of PID in which the NK cell abnormality represents the major immunological defect resulting in the clinical immunodeficiency.
Clinical Immunodeficiency with NK Cell Abnormalities .
A gene defect that interferes with NK cell development, maturation or survival resulting in a population of NK cells in the peripheral blood that is undetectable, or unusually small.
In fNKD, NK cells are present in numbers that fall within normal ranges, the developmental defect conferred by cNKD can be assessed by NK cell developmental subset study and is accompanied by impaired functional maturation.
An index of suspicion is particularly relevant in identifying fNKD patients .
There are 6 genes that have been described as at least in part causing NKD .
I am aware of additional NKD gene candidates through patients we are investigating in our own program as well as candidate genes that have been shared with me by colleagues.
A number of genes can be identified as causes of NKD, and many of them can be predicted.
Emberger Syndrome and GATA2 that can cause a range of clinical presentations including myelodysplasia and Emberger Syndrome .
The GATA2 and MCM4 genes have been associated with NKD, but the original NKD case associated with them was stable and well-studied.
In the RTEL1 NKD case, the original case was fairly specific although aberrations in this gene typically causes immunodeficiency and not NKD.
Be one of NK cells and be evident in the original investigation .
Genotypephenotype connections to clinical presentation of NKD .

NKD variations and relations to broader combined immunodeficiencies.
I have been personally evaluating patients for NKD for a variety of reasons, most notably including atypical manifestations of Herpesviruses and some warts.
In the interest of best directing patient care, it is important to delineate true NKD from cases in which NK cell function or numbers may be transiently depressed or are stably impaired due to a PID that impacts NK cells.
Numbers or functional tests should similarly not be labeled as having an NKD.
A herpesviral infection that could represent a contribution from aberrant NK cell defenses.
An abnormal test result should be considered in the context of the known conditions and medications that can affect test results.
In using NK cell tests, it is also important that they be applied with some degree of index of clinical suspicion.
Infections caused by HSV do not generally cause NKD .
The future of NKD as a primary immunodeficiency depends upon getting the diagnosis correct and accumulating valid experience in the overarching NKD field.

The first set of tests are those that measure an NK cell function and those most commonly used in clinical laboratories are flow cytometry and cytotoxicity.
A comparison of clinical and non-clinical tests for NKD.
Two tests measure different things and both may be needed to ultimately define the NK cell abnormality in a given patient.

A critical time, uncovering a vulnerability leading to a clinical manifestation of NKD.
A review of the clinical history, active issues and ongoing concerns for NKD patients.
No specific indications for their use in NKD.
I find it useful to determine whether a patient has experienced other herpesviral infections via immunoglobulin G titer testing, and if they have to obtain viral nucleic acid tests to ensure that they are not actively infected.
Hyperimmune immunoglobulin, particularly for CMV, is probably best reserved for difficult to treat infections in the context of NKD as directed by clinical circumstances, and not for prophylaxis.
I now recommend utilizing recombinant zoster vaccine if possible, given the presumed cost-benefit and lack of other known vaccine-related illness in NKD patients.
Bias is not an excuse for herpesviral infection.
I treat NKD patients with active infections using acyclovir, famciclovir or valacyclovIR.
Recurrence of infection when prophylaxis is stopped.
Interferon -α and IFN-γ can stimulate other relevant antiviral defenses and have the potential to be useful.

In this section, we have discussed how studies in past on chikungunya outbreaks could help us for the development of antibodies with therapeutic potential.
Protection from CHIKV infection due to neutralizing antibodies.
Inactivated or attenuated whole virion CHIKV induce strong neutralizing IgG response and an effective in vivo protection.
Early neutralizing antibodies can be responsible for lifelong protection against CHIKV infection .
Infection patients with high viral load rapidly develop high levels of anti-CHIKV IgG3 antibodies and these patients develop persistent arthralgia.
Chikungunya virus detected in macrophages, while it is plausible that these viruses are in non-replicative stage.
The absence of early IgG3-specific antibodies in the early stage of acute infection could serve as a specific marker for patients with increased risk of disease.
Pre-exposure therapy of neutralizing antibodies to healthy pregnant women could also protect the newborn from subsequent infections .
In the human immune system, 30% of circulating antibodies are IgM.
Early IgM response in viral infection is important to confer protection, particularly in early stages of infection.
IgM responses first appear as early as days 2-4 of onset of symptoms, and their appearance from day 6 is associated with a reduction in viral load .
A long-lasting IgM response to CHIKV infection is believed to be due to viral persistence, though the exact mechanism is not well characterized.
The long term survival and persistence of CHIKV have been reported in non-human primate by evading immune defense mechanisms .
A neutralizing monoclonal IgM antibody isolated from mice has shown to block the virus attachment in the permissive host cells .
The amount and timing of the appearance of neutralizing antibodies have a major significant impact on CHIKV clinical outcomes.

Viruses can escape antibody responses by undergoing genetic mutations that abolish antigen specificity and antigen-antibody binding or by indirect immune evasion strategies such as cell-to-cell transmission.
The use of combination of neutralizing mAbs targeting two different epitopes or by developing bispecific antibodies controls immune escape during the acute phase of viral infection.

MVPA and PAQ in vigorous youth with and without CCD.
R: a language and environment for statistical computing.

Frailness in children with end-stage liver disease .
We used multiple measures for some of the domains as we have previously described; this is because it yet unclear which measures could be of most value in generating a future pediatric frailty score.

Lurz et al. assigned frailty scores for each component based on arbitrary Z score cutoffs, with the maximum possible score being 10 .
Our CCD cohort had lower anthropometric measures and triceps fold thickness compared to controls, though mid arm circumference was similar.
Measurement of triceps skinfold thickness should be considered in assessing CCD as it is less affected by other factors such as genetic or chromosomal anomalies.
A study in adults with congenital heart disease demonstrated markedly impaired peak oxygen consumption even in participants in NYHA class I as compared to healthy controls .
We did not find a difference in the CCD group for the different NYHA classes; this is likely because the study was underpowered to detect differences.

Identifying the frailty phenotype in children could be beneficial in identifying those individuals at risk for adverse health outcomes.
This study is a first step towards the creation of a frailty score in CCD.
A Fontan participant walked across a small hallway and they may have lost time in turning around thereby affecting the total distance covered.
Children with CCD perform worse across all the domains of frailty as compared to age and gender matched healthy controls.

Heart transplantation is the gold standard treatment for stage D heart failure .
A look at the state of the NHS in England and Wales.
In light of the donor shortage and inferior outcomes seen with retransplantation as compared with primary transplantation, gaining an understanding of factors that affect outcome with retansplantation is paramount to being proper stewards of this precious resource and selecting patients that are most likely to benefit.
Retransplantation accounts for 5% of heart transplants performed in younger age group between 18 and 39 .
Retransplant recipients are on average younger, more sensitized, and tend to be more acutely ill with worse renal function, increased likelihood of being hospitalized, on dialysis, intubated, on inotropes, or supported with extracorporeal

Retransplantation patients are more likely to experience hypertension, hyperlipidemia, renal dysfunction, and are at increased risk for early and late rejection, graft failure, and CAV compared with first time pediatric heart transplantation .
Primary Pediatric Transplantation and Retransplantation .
Balancing the allocation of a scarce resource and our responsibility to society with our obligation to individual patients who are in need of a second heart transplant will always be a dilemma for the heart transplant community.
Heart retransplantation in the most recent era of 2002 to 2012 has been associated with improved outcomes.
Using mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to retransplantation has been associated with lower survival compared with retrans transplantation without MCS bridge.
Retransplantation is still inferior to primary transplantation and further study is needed to understand not only when to offer retrans transplantation but how to best manage these candidates after retransplant.

Patients are representative of a new society based on speed and intolerance to frustration, with negative resonances on the doctorpatient relationship.
Most surgeons insisted on this societal mutation making health a right, which causes a "tacit shift from the obligation of means to the obligated of result"
Health is no longer a privilege but a right, and that has a terrible impact on the patients' relationship with their illness, their pain, their sequelae.
The surgeon is seen as a supplier whose result can be demanded and held accountable because he is paid, in a country where access to health is not very expensive.
A doctor's office is not a shop, a doctor is a hospital, a hospital is a clinic.
The Internet provides non-selective access to information that can interfere with the physician's explanations and call into question his or her conclusions.
We want everything, right away, it's the internet society where you can order stuff in just a click.
Surgeons described a judicialization of their job that they believe follows the US model, following a distrust with patients who would see medical error or fault everywhere.
Free surgery is good, except that the procedure is completely free, you just go online, fill in a form and that's it.
Financial motivation for compensation, resentment due to a lack of explanation or the feeling that the physician may hide elements can also lead to a complaint process.
Surgeons saw themselves as the ideal perpetrator, symbolically the one who performs the aggressive act.
The surgeon is always the culprit... it's always the surgeon.
Facing the complaint When a new complaint is announced, physicians described feelings of discouragement, injustice, or anger if they feel that this is not justified.
I've been working at a new company for a few months, and I feel like the more I go on, the more it gets me down.
We identified patients at risk but remained critical of their own a priori.
A change in practices: strengthening consultation information, informed consent, and trackability .
We increasingly find ourselves treating people based on the medico-legal risks rather than the interests of the patient on a purely medical level.
Some physicians did not perceive this situation as only negative, by imposing new professional standards, breaking with the image of the "omniscient and solitary" surgeon .
An insidious pressure, which is permanently interfering in their daily lives, even outside working hours.
A growing fatigue is developing, which can either precipitate an early retirement decision or lead the surgeon to another career.
I'm probably less tolerant of people constantly complaining, but that's probably not such a bad thing because it will enable me to retire.
In this paper, we explored the possibility of changing careers in the face of pressure.
In this paper, we look at whether or not you should carry on working, or should I be doing something else, a less complicated job.
The judicialization of surgical practice provokes an alteration of the doctor-patient relationship and a perceived insecurity, leading surgeons to consider coping strategies, defensive practices, and even interrupting or modifying their careers.
Did the interviewed surgeons overlook a global societal change in the relationship to authority and knowledge?
A gap may arise between a technically successful surgery and the secondary disappointment of a result that is ultimately partial or even absent .
Private surgeons complain that patients have become "health consumers" and adaptive procedures are experienced in an unfavorable way.
In this paper, we explored the role of medicine in improving the health of a group of people.
Patients are not seen as enemies, they are seen as threats .
In France, the 2002 law system has made it easy for patients to initiate a complaint free of charge, which, even if it will not often lead to the effective demonstration of a fault, remains the dark side of the profession.
An analysis of data from the French main insurance company demonstrates that only 15% of expert reviews conclude that the case is unfavorable to the surgeon.

Private medicine must remain at the center of our efforts, but unfortunately the busy schedule of private medicine is sometimes incompatible with the availability that each patient requires .
Reading a qualitative study can be disconcerting for the reader accustomed to the quantified results .
Private surgeons are very vulnerable in our judicial system, and therefore the expression of their feelings can be transposed .
Our study makes it possible to detail the discomfort within a profession that experiences a double exposure: first, not only because of the high-risk nature of spinal surgery but also because of a breach of trust in the traditional doctor-patient relationship.

 monitoring and optimizing CPP as a targeted therapy has shown promise to improve outcomes in children with critical illness.
Children with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) are at increased risk of infection and hemorrhage from ICP/CPP therapy.
Children with severe TBI are less likely than adults to receive invasive ICP monitors.
Children with coagulopathy in the setting of sepsis or liver failure, or while undergoing support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation .
Identifying a non-invasive, simple means by which CPP can accurately and reliably be quantified and monitored in children .
We propose two methods for non-invasively estimating cerebral CrCP .
CrCP/CPPe derived according to these methods would have good agreement with invasively monitored CPP in children.
We performed a retrospective review of data previously gathered from 2011 to 2015 for a prospective, observational study in a tertiary care pediatric intensive care unit.
Zero, followed by a vasoactive infusion.
A sonographer uses a pulsed probe and commercially available ultrasonography unit for TCD .
Towards the end of the study, TCD monitoring was monitored daily through death or hospital day 8.

Convolution of CPP and CrCP/CPPe with Bland-Altman plot .
Estimated CPP as a screening tool for low CPP .
Real-time TCD recordings before, during, and after physiologic derangements that allowed for the calculation of serial CrCPs.

CrCP/CPPe increased to 72.9 mmHg as ICP increased .
A non-invasive method for CPP monitoring in critically ill children with a variety of primary diagnoses.
Cereal perfusion pressure invasively estimate CPP in adult patients .
We evaluate the utility of two methods to non-invasively estimate CPP in children with severe TBI.
CrCP/CPPe is insufficient for clinical use; changes to CrCP and CPP over time appropriately reflected underlying pathophysiologic alterations.
The first method we evaluated, Czosnyka et al. found, using the same formula, that the absolute difference between CPP and CPPe was < 10 mmHg in 89% of measurements with a 95% confidence range for prediction of the actual CPP no wider than ± 12 mm
The use of both of these methods to non-invasively estimate CPP in adult patients based on a good correlation between the invasively measured and estimated CPP.
A Bland-Altman plot compares the agreement of two measurement techniques by plotting the difference of two paired measurements against the mean of two measurements.
CPPe overestimated CPP by 19.61 mmHg with wide 95% CI of ± 40mmHg on Bland-Altman analysis .
CrCP for 2 = 72.9 and CrCP for 3 = 39.9.
CPPe was noted to have a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 91%, and a positive predictive value of 27% to predict CPP below 50 mmHg.
Cereal hypoperfusion with increased CPP is unlikely to be caused by any of these methods.
The study revealed modestly improved agreement between the estimated and invasively measured CPP in children who had not undergone decompressive craniotomy compared with those that had.
Autoregulation contributed to the slightly improved agreement in patients who had not undergone DC.
The CrCP/CPPe reflects the net effect of local and systemic physiologic or pathologic alterations on the cerebral circulation.
The effects of therapeutic strategies on the effective cerebral perfusion pressure.
CrCP and CrCP/CPPe trended in the expected direction based on the measurement of simultaneously captured invasive parameters.
Response to therapeutic interventions in children with acute, severe, neurologic illness.
We were unable to determine if there were certain patient characteristics that determined good versus poor agreement between the presented methods and the invasively measured CPP.
With disease processes that have different pathophysiologic mechanisms and more diffuse versus heterogeneous neurologic injury may have different levels of agreement.
A number of studies have shown that TCD can be difficult to compare to invasively measured CPP in terms of accuracy and interpretability.
CPP can only be used as a screening tool over time, and the current state of the art is not good enough.
CPPe and CrCP/CPPe do not have clinical values in the noninvasive estimation of absolute CPP measured invasively or to detect cerebral hypoperfusion.
Hypercapnic respiratory failure is often caused by common respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , obesity hypoventilation syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea .
A study of patients discharged from the intensive care unit following an episode of acute HRF reported that 46% of patients were readmitted, and 17% died within 12 months.
Eighty-eight% readmitted and 49% dead within 12 months for patients treated with NIV .
Hypercapnia in patients with multiple comorbidities related to obesity and tobacco use .
The purpose of the current study was to investigate outcomes of patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of HRF, rather than just those identified for treatment with NIV.
The late mortality following the index admission, and the late mortality after the admission.
We identified patients ≥18 years admitted with a diagnosis of HRF identified by ICD 10 diagnostic codes.
A measure of chronic illness and risk of mortality .
Data abstracted from the electronic medical record included demographics, co-morbidities, hospital course and course after discharge .

Fractional polynomial regression in STATA 15.1 .
We generated a Kaplan-Meier estimator of the survival function, with a 95% confidence interval, of patients hospitalized with HRF .
One hundred and two patients met eligibility criteria and were included in this study.
Those who survived to hospital discharge had significantly worse hemodynamics than those who died.
A rapid heart rate in the first 24 h was associated with increased risk of readmission.
We investigated characteristics of participants who died following discharge, compared to those who survived.
More than half of index admission patients died within 30 days .
Multi-variable logistic regression showed the following factors predicted risk of death : for every 5 years increased age, the aOR of death was 1.32 ; the adjusted odds of death in those using home oxygen at the time of the index admission was 4.03 .
Timing of death relative to index admission in hospital discharge .
Inpatient mortality of patients admitted with acute HRF requiring NIV .
A diagnosis of HRF identifies a patient population at high risk of 30-day readmission.
A diagnosis of peripheral vascular disease identified patients at particularly high risk of readmission in multivariate regression analysis.
Peripheral vascular disease is a marker of chronic illness severity that increases risk of readmission for patients.
Only 17% of patients were discharged on any form of ventilatory support or bilevel positive airway pressure .
Thirty-six patients died in the period following hospital discharge .
Use of chronic home oxygen in patients with hypercapnia is associated with increased risk of death.
A limitation of our study is that patients were identified using ICD 10.0 codes for HRF; patients who were misidentified with HRF could have been missed and not included in our analysis.
Hypercapnic respiratory failure caused 80% of deaths and admissions in the first year of the study.
The mortality rate in patients admitted to the hospital with HRF is high, and there is a high rate of 30 day readmission, and the months after discharge.
Use of home oxygen is associated with an increased risk of death-independent of other factors-and that few patients were treated with CPAP or BIPAP and none with NIV.

No between-group differences in the need for supplemental oxygen or ventilator support in the 24 h following birth .
iNO is essential in the prenatal-to-perinatal pulmonary transition, just as it does in infants with PPHN.
iNO is safe and does not increase oxidative stress or lung inflammation.
Asphyxiated lambs resuscitated with 100% oxygen showed increased superoxide anions in pulmonary arteries compared to 21% oxygen resuscitation.
iNO during resuscitation causes less oxidative stress and bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
The iNO was slowly down-titrated, at 10 min of resuscitation.
Inhaled nitric oxide as an adjunct to neonatal resuscitation in premature.
The vasodilator effect of iNO appears to be sustained, despite having a very short half-life .

We stopped recruitment before reaching our initial target sample size.
As a pilot trial: as a pilottrial.
Administration of iNO as an adjunct gas during neonatal resuscitation is feasible and decreases the amount of exposure to supplemental oxygen in very preterm infants.

P. falciparum has the longest gametocyte development, which spans five morphologically distinct phases 23 .
In P. falciparum, the establishment of an IMC during early gametocyte development coincides with modifications of the cytoskeleton of the infected RBC, including integration of exported parasite antigens, and results in a reversible stiffening of the iRBC.

P. falciparum infections and necropsies of non-human primates infected with P. berghei found most asexual and gametocyte stages in the parenchyma and sinusoids.
Bone marrow-resident RBC precursors are metabolically more active than mature RBCs, and therefore intracellular pathogens, such as malaria parasites, are exposed to reduced drug concentrations.
Exposing parasites to sublethal drug concentrations in this compartment mimics current in vitro protocols to select for drugresistant parasites 90 and therefore may increase the likelihood of emergence and spread of drug resistance.

Neonatal transport teams reported that multiple phone calls often occurred between referral and receiving hospital personnel to check bed availability, staffing, and insurance.
A transfer center streamlined the transport process and coordinated the logistics of transport-ambulance, helicopter, or fixed wing-while the team prepared to leave.
Team composition varied between teams and was based on a variety of factors including acuity of transport, the gestational age and/or respiratory status of the baby, and the skill level and experience of team members.
Transport modes included ground, helicopter, and fixed wing.
Using live video in the ambulance during transport to show the baby to a neonatologist at the receiving hospital.
Emergent neonatal transport can be unpredictable, with no way of knowing when it will occur.
Transport teams reported working with a wide range of referral hospitals, from an emergency room at a community hospital up to level III NICU.
The unpredictability of transport may contribute to variable departure from the receiving facility based on staffing availability, ambulance availability, and ambulance parking location.
Staffing was cited as a major reason to decline transport.
We always find it hard to get the correct staff together for a transport.
RNs and RTs are frequently pulled from other assignments or delivery room coverage, and this either delayed times to departure for transport teams and/or left gaps in coverage for inpatient care.
A dedicated transport team would be ideal to solve staffing problems, several teams expressed.
Transport is the biggest issue and obstacle in improving our entire process.
A NICU neonate needs a dedicated ambulance that can accommodate the needs of a neonate.
Team members reported miscommunications when placing a request for pick-up with the ambulance company and drivers who were not readily available.
The ambulance that we were receiving did not have inverters, they were only providing us with oxygen and not the metal gear.
We asked teams for ways to protect the baby in ambulances, especially in older rigs and even in newer rigs.
Babies are being suspended from rides that are painful, dangerous, and don't provide accurate information.
Low lighting, loud noise, lack of space that permits only one person to have access to the baby, and limited cell signal that may prevent the team from communicating with the neonatologist.
We usually go for the sicker kids in the helicopter and I want to have my ducks in a row.
High-risk neonatal transport is high-risk and often low-volume compared to inpatient care and has an unpredictable revenue stream.
Transport is of the nature where transport is a necessity for hospitals, but it is not a money maker.
Preparation and planning ahead are critical to transport success, teams reported.
Teamwork and trust are key to success, according to teams in this study.
Few hospitals had dedicated transport teams, whereby they assigned RNs, RTs, and even physicians to be on call for transport at all times.
Our team has been together for 15 years, and we have developed our knowledge, skills, and confidence in the types of patients that we are seeing from our facilities.
A clinical situation may change between when a call comes in from the referral hospital and when the transport team arrives, and some teams reported that information on the intake form was often insufficient or inaccurate.
We recognize that with one particular hospital we get a good clear report; they manage babies very well.
Efforts to establish good relationships with referral hospitals contributed to staff at referral hospitals taking a more active role in helping with care once the transport team arrived.
We do not show any signs of disrespect for the referring physician base or what they have done.
Transport teams reported that referral hospitals may not have the time or resources to simultaneously stabilize a sick baby and prepare a report for the transport team.
To visualize the patient and make clinical recommendations to the referral team prior to the transport team arrival.

Out-the-door time, blood glucose, and temperature metrics were reviewed at different times,monthly, quarterly, or yearly.
Emergent neonatal transport: challenges and strengths.
A qualitative evaluation of neonatal transport teams in the state of California .
A neonatologist-led transport team does not represent a deficiency in care as the literature on transports has shown no significant difference.
Unpredictability is a key feature that impacts team performance during emergent transports.
Hospital-based staffing for transport teams is economical but takes personnel away from in house patient assignments, delays departure, and lacks flexibility.
A study of Neonatal Emergency Transport Services operating in Liguria, Italy found that teams needed to carry out 200-350 transports per year in order to be financially viable.
We found that unit-based transport teams carried out less than 200 transports each year.
No metric exists to measure the revenue brought to the hospital by each patient who is transported.
Teamwork is beneficial, experience with staff at referral hospitals helps manage expectations, and planning for all clinical scenarios is critical.
Staffing is a common reason for declining transport and major contributor to delayed departure times.
No dedicated ambulance onsite at the receiving hospital, factors including traffic and transport timing affect the ability for a team to quickly obtain ground transportation.
Noise, cramped spaces, and loud noises that restrict communication and access to the baby.
Transport teams feel a lack of support from administrations for ensuring staff for transport and securing funding for skills days and equipment.
The intake form is inadequate, the transport form is dated, insufficient, or inaccurate.
Established working relationships among transport team members and experience doing transports together contributes to overall strength and performance.
Experience with referral hospitals helps with managing expectations for transport.
Pre-stocking transport bags with equipment and supplies necessary for a range of clinical scenarios.
Training for transport team members varies widely. Also variable is the duration of training for new members.
Debriefing after transport and case review improve the quality of transports.
Outreach programs based on feedback from referral hospitals help train staff at referral hospitals.
Hierarchical transport teams are characterized by some sort of hierarchical leadership, and establishing transfer centers and implementing telemedicine may improve and streamline communication throughout the transport process.
A free-standing transfer center shared by several hospitals or other units within a hospital could potentially be an economical solution.
We interviewed transport teams only in California and recognize that the operation of teams in other states in the U.S. is different.
Neonatal transport in the developing world may differ from that in the developed world.
Dedicated transport teams are composed of providers who have significant experience working together and the opportunity to maintain their skills as a team.
Transfer centers streamline communication and ensure all requisite intake information is collected.
Videoconferencing for remote neonatal evaluation and transport.

This study has some limitations regarding nonhomogeneity of its data, as most of the patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria during the study period were infants, so the data does not accurately represent children and adolescents age group.
Spinal cord injury-associated pneumonia is a very frequent complication and a leading cause of death after SCI .
A sensitive, specific and feasible diagnostic pathway is essential for decision-making in the management of SCI-AP.
In the context of the SCI-IDS, some diagnostic CDCcriteria for a 'clinically defined pneumonia'
Leucocyte counts of patients with SCI-AP are substantially altered due to SCI itself and may therefore be of limited significance for the diagnosis of the disease.
This survey investigates the clinical algorithms relevant for SCI-AP and analyses the utility of the CDC-criteria for the diagnosis of the disease.

Endotracheal intubation is a key intervention in trauma care, but it is not without risks.
Intubating patients with "moderate" cognitive impairment .
Endotracheal intubation puts patients at risk of hypotension, exposes them to sedating and paralyzing medications, and usually mandates an intensive care unit stay.
Intubation in trauma patients with a GCS of 8 or less using a nationally representative database .
Intubation for patients with GCS between 6 and 8 would increase the length of stay.
We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the 2016 National Trauma Data Bank .
We excluded patients that were transferred to another hospital, either from the emergency department or later in their hospital stay because we could not ascertain the primary outcomes of interest.
We counted patients as having been intubated on arrival if they carried an ICD9 or ICD-10 code for endotracheal intubation and the timestamp associated with that code was within 1 h of arrival.
A flow diagram of inclusions and exclusions .

A small observational study, noting that many emergency department providers advocate intubation for GCS ≤ 8 in intoxicated patients, reported safe management without intubated patients.
The first study to our knowledge of the effect of intubation on trauma patients with marginal GCS.
Inverse probability weighting increases the mortality risk of intubating those with a GCS of 8.
A large sample size and power allowed us to detect this result and generate a statistically sound study.
We chose to define "intubation" as those who were intubated within an hour of arrival.
A small number of delayed intubations over two hours.
We are not able to exclude confounding by indication as a possible reason for the association between intubation and mortality we describe.
An analysis stratified by head injury shows that GCS are associated with mortality, but the dataset does not contain data on indication for intubation.
We have demonstrated that for patients with a GCS of 6-8, after adjustment for severity of injury, those who were observed would benefit from intubation.
Intubation without GCS score does not increase mortality risk and may have in fact been subject to a lower risk.
Intubation on arrival for patients with GCS of 6-8 is associated with increased mortality, ICU days, and overall length of stay.

Biodegradable and bio-based polymers .
Polymerization of D-and L-LAc mixture leads to the formation of heterochiral, atactic PLDLA with amorphous properties.
PLA is susceptible to hydrolysis and under the conditions of the human body enzymatically decomposes into LAc, which occurs naturally in living organisms.
 PLA has been utilized as material for drug delivery microspheres and scaffolds for cell growth.
Microstructures with specific pores and density can modulate the biological response .
Electrospinning of PLA fibers modified with inorganic particles using an electric field .

A Binary-solvent system was used to fabricate PLA-based nonwovens.
The gap between tip of needle and collector, and polymer concentration, were selected to obtain fibers modified with ceramic particles .
The morphology of the composite fiber was examined using SEM, and ceramic additives caused a reduction in average fiber diameter.
In both cases, the fiber surface was wrinkled and defected.
Exposure of PLA fibers to irradiation for 10 min and 1 h did not significantly affect their morphology.
Fibers in PLA nonwoven were arranged parallel to the direction of the collector rotation in major part, as shown in Fig. 4a .
Fiber broke under the UV radiation, it relaxed and changed its direction to a more favorable energetically.
The aging process leads to structural changes in polymer, what is directly translated into thermal properties of PLA.
Glass transition temperature decreases due to the less need for fiber to go into a highly elastic state.
Addition of ceramic particles significantly reduced the temperatures of transformation processes and their energy.
Energy doubled for composite fibers modified with TiO 2 particles.
Melting of PLA/ZnO composite began at a slightly higher temperature compared to pure PLA and other composites.
The positive impact of ZnO particles on PLA stability was also demonstrated by the lack of a significant increase in glass transition energy for 4 h of degradation.
TiO 2 particles are used as a material absorbing UV radiation in sunlight and are expected to provide the best protection against photodegradation.

EAST only conditionally recommended rib fixation surgery to decrease mortality, hospital and ICU length of stay, incidence of pneumonia, and need for tracheostomy in 2017.
We offer the procedure to mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU with respiratory failure felt to be predominately due to their multiple rib fractures and in the absence of a contraindication.
Pneumothorax is a common finding after trauma, and there is a spectrum of clinical presentations ranging from incidental findings of occult pneumothorrix .
A pneumothorax which is visible on plain chest X-ray following trauma should be treated with the placement of an intercostal drain.
A group of occult pneumothoraces identified in whole-body computed tomography following trauma should be managed with careful observation.
Tension pneumothorax is a rapidly lethal condition where air enters the pleural space via with a one-way flap mechanism, gradually building up more and more positive pressure within the Pleural space, Eventually, the positive pressure builds to the point where mediastinal structures shift toward the opposite hem
Bedside trauma ultrasonography during the initial primary survey and in the differential diagnosis of any unanticipated deterioration of a trauma patient.
The priority in the management of tension pneumothorax is decompression of the pleura.
The Committee on Trauma of the American College of Surgeons has revised their recommendation in the Advanced Trauma Life Support 10th edition to suggesting the fourth or fifth intercostal space between the mid-and anterior axillary lines as the optimal site of decompression in adults .
A formal intercostal drain should ideally follow.
 needle decompression as an initial emergency technique; finger thoracostomy or rapid intercostal drain insertion.
A large amount of bleeding into the pleura results in massive hemothorax.
Obstructive shock from impaired venous return due to high pressure exerted within the pleural space .
Sudden decelerative forces, such as those experienced during a high-speed motor vehicle crash or high fall, can lead to blunt aortic injury.
Endovascular management is the most common method of managing blunt aortic injury.
Blunt cardiac injury can occur as the heart collides with the sternum and chest wall during sudden decelerative forces, such as being ejected from a motor vehicle.
Blunt cardiac injury can develop and lead to arrhythmias and impaired myocardial function .
A normal serial 12-lead electrocardiogram in the context of a hemodynamically normal patient appears to be reassuring .
Unexplained shock or hypotension in a patient who has sustained a high-energy decelerative force should prompt consideration of significant blunt cardiac injury.
A regional analgesia technique is as yet undefined, although there is increasing evidence for paravertebral catheters.
In this paper, we present limited evidence for the efficacy of this technique.
The most recent edition of ATLS® has recommended pleural decompression in the fourth to fifth intercostal space between the mid-and anterior axillary lines, utilizing either needle decompression or finger thoracostom.

Association of multiple placental pathologies with BPD and NDI .
Infants with multiple pathologic lesions are more likely to develop BPD .
The presence of multiple placental pathologic lesions in preterm infants is associated with subsequent neonatal morbidity and NDI.
We found that people who develop NDI in childhood are more likely to develop it in later life.
The association between BPD and placental pathologies such as MVU, FTV, chronic villitis, villous edema, and acute chorioamnionitis has been inconsistent.
AHC and development of BPD in gestational age placenta .
A lack of documentation of multiple placental pathologic lesions was strongly associated with the occurrence of BPD.
Excess of amniotic fluid anti-angiogenic factors such as VEGF receptor antagonist gms-like tyrokinase-1, 27 and subsequent chronic fetal hypoxia leads to the classic histologic findings of BPD.
We speculate that the association of BPD with multiple placental lesions, but not with isolated pathology, suggests that there are interactive effects between vascular and inflammatory processes that promote the development of B PD.

Peanut OIT clinical trials for desensitization .
The PALISADE group of clinical investigators conducted an international phase 3 randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating AR101 .
Day maintenance treatment for 24 weeks with peanut protein on exit DBPCFC.
The active-drug group withdrew from the trial due to chronic or recurrent dose-limiting gastrointestinal symptoms.
A small sample size and high withdrawal rate means EOE may have been underestimated.
A lower and slower dosing regimen could achieve similar outcomes to prior studies and improve safety.
A study of peanut protein and treatment-related AEs.
A slower up-dosing schedule and lower maintenance doses could potentially still yield clinically meaningful desensitization with improvement in the safety profile of OIT.

Long-term peanut OIT in adults and children.
The peanut-0 group reached and passed the DBPCFC to cumulative dose of 4000 mg at weeks 104 and 117.
 peanut group-0 group was less likely to reach 4000 mg than peanut-300 group at week 117.
 peanut OIT is able to desensitize patients with peanut allergy to 4000 mg of peanut protein, however, with reduction or discontinuation, there is an increased risk of clinical reactivity .
Basophil AUC was suppressed from baseline in patients with SU and TD at the end of OIT.
OIT is an investigative therapy that can lead to desensitization. While the hope is to allow for protection from accidental exposures and thus improve the quality of life, the process of OIT involves continued exposure to the allergen.
The SAPS group was encouraged to think of symptoms as a positive signal associated with increasing desensitization.
Another adjunctive therapy being evaluated to improve the rates of these side effects as well as improve the compliance of treatment is co-administration of a biologic.
Peanut OIT in U.S. allergy practices .
A study of peanut OIT in allergy practices found that 94% of practices performed peanut food challenges.
 peanut OIT raises the threshold of reaction and in certain patients can achieve sustained unresponsiveness.

Acinetobacter baumannii is a major cause of nosocomial infection in intensive care units and often develops resistance to antimicrobials .
Hospital-acquired infections with Gram-negative bacteria, especially AB, are more common in the summer and are associated with high ambient outdoor temperatures.
The literature on the relationship between temperature and bacterial infections is scarce, and the independent association is inconclusive.
Temperature-influenced AB infections of patients admitted to NICU.
The retrospective collection of data from patients and their analyses have been approved by the ethics committee of Tianjin Medical University General Hospital.
The recovery of MDR-ABP was defined as the primary outcome measure for this study.
In this paper, we look at mortality, and we find that mortality can be caused by many things.
MDR in AB was defined as resistance to three or more of the following five classes of antibiotics that are typically prescribed to treat AB.
A hospital discharge or death: hospital discharge, death.
The inclusion criteria for ABP were as follows: one or more positive respiratory secretion cultures for AB according to the positive criteria defined in the next paragraph.
The respiratory secretions were quantitatively cultured to meet the following criteria for the diagnosis of ABP: bacterial counts ≥ 10 3 colony-forming units per milliliter .
Quarantined patients were immediately quarantined and strict precautions were taken to prevent crosstransmission .
A three-bed LTLFW that admitted highly contagious patients with uncontrollable fever to control fever and prevent cross-infection after diagnosed as MDR-ABP.
Transfer from NICU to LTLFW: a case study .
The clinical recovery of ABP patients was defined as simultaneous normalizations of highest body temperature , leukocyte count , PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratio , and no or 1+ in AB culture.

QRT-PCR for chronic infections using RND pumps and intI1 .
RNA extracted using an RNA Purification Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Categorical variables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation or median as indicated in each specific data set.
Approximation of association between AOT and ABP diagnosis and ABI .
MDR-ABP patients were diagnosed as ABP on the basis of clinical symptoms and microbiological tests, leading to an overall incidence of 6.45% or 3.47/1000 patient-days.
MDR-ABP patients in LTLFW group had significantly improved outcomes as compared to those in non-LTL FW group, defined by high rates of recovery and overall good prognosis.
Average ABI and PABTBI were substantially low in the winter months and positively associated with mean AOTs.
A. baumannii isolates are positively associated with monthly and seasonal average daily temperatures in Tianjin.
Increasing temperature is linearly predictive of increasing numbers of ABI.
Bacteria that can cause pneumonia, such as S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and S. maltophilia, are not significantly different from seasonal average.
Cefoperazone/sulbactam for Acinetobacter baumannii pneumonia .
We observed significant difference in AB growth at 30°C and 35°C .

We observed seasonal or temperature variations in the incidence of ABI and ABP in China.
Acinetobacter Bacteria in the summer are more virulent than those in the winter .
AB grew slowly and had reduced antibiotic resistance in low temperature environment .
AB growing at 20°C and 25°C had significantly reduced viability and antibiotic resistance than 35°C.
Pneumonia in a small town in the north-east of Italy .
A small sample size, and retrospective study was performed in a single-center, and thus, prospective randomized trials are required to determine the effect of temperature on AB infections.
A low-temperature environment reduces the density, virulence, and antibiotic resistance of MDR-ABP.

The study protocol was approved by our institutional ethics committee , and written informed consent was obtained from all the participants.
A new tracheal suctioning simulator .
A custom three-dimensional printer fixture attached to a tracheal tube .
A three-dimensional motion capture system of the hand, wrist, and forearm .
A 10-s period of suctioning with a catheter in the tracheal tube.
We completed the suctioning within the required 10 s.
Unsupervised suctioning of tracheal tube .
The end of the withdrawal phase was defined as the time point when the tip of the catheter reached the opening of the tracheal tube . The amount of phlegm suctioned was calculated as the change in weight.
The radial styloid process defined the path of wrist motion.
The statistical analysis was processed using SPSS Statistics version 22.0 .
The time series profile of the radial styloid process and of the tip of thumb are shown in Fig. 2 for two different trials with different amount of phlegm suctioned .
The mean amount of phlegm suctioned per second was significantly larger for the Ns group than for the St group .
A look at the state of the NHS in England and Wales.
The amount of phlegm suctioned was positively correlated to L max .
The vertical path of motion of the forearm and the angular velocity of the thumb are significant for phlegm suctioning .
 biomechanics contribute to the effectiveness of tracheal suctioning.
Nurses in the Ns group inserted the catheter to a length > 10 cm, which is achieved by four of the 12 students in the St group .
We noted a longer vertical motion of the wrist in Ns than St group, but with no difference in forearm motion between the two groups.
The quasi-invariant condition of our task might explain differences between the biomechanical characteristics of expert and novice performance observed in the present study and those described in previous studies.
The amount of phlegm suctioned was positively correlated to the maximum length of catheter insertion .
The amount of phlegm suctioned did correlate positively with the length of the vertical path of wrist and forearm motion, and the mean angular velocity of the catheter.
The combination of linear and rotational movement of the catheter reduces the risk of suction-induced bleeding, and increases the likelihood of contact with phlegm located on the wall of the trachea.
The limitations of our study need to be acknowledged in the interpretation of results.
We found that faster vertical wrist and forearm motion, combined with a greater angular motion of the thumb, improved the effectiveness of the suctioning.

Long-term survival and excess mortality in a well-defined Norwegian population.
The study was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics North .
Stavanger University Hospital is the only hospital serving the population of South Rogaland County.
A single-centre population-based retrospective observational study, including all patients from SUHs primary catchment area operated for rAAA during the period from January 2000 to December 2014.
Survival and mortality data were obtained from the prospectively maintained electronic patient record database at the hospital.
RAAA was confirmed by extravasation of blood on computed tomography and/or a periaortic haematoma on operation.
Comorbidity was defined as evidence in past medical history of organ or system diseases.
The patients' physical status was classified according to the American Society of Anaesthesiologists Physical Status Classification into five classes where class 1 is a normally healthy patient and class 5 is a moribund patient who is not expected to survive for 24 h.
Complications after surgery are classified as minor or major, major defined as complications requiring reintervention under general anaesthesia or the presence of multiorgan failure.

Evaluating the effect of rAAA on long-term health .
A large number of patients had known heart disease and increasing age was associated with mortality .
Early and late complications leading to surgical intervention are listed in Table 3 : 24 early complications were registered in 18 patients as four patients needed intervention.
One patient died from septicaemia, while the other was successfully treated with antibiotics.
The cumulative number of reinterventions per patient had a significant impact on long-term survival .

A population-based observational study of patients undergoing open surgery for rAAA and surviving the first 30 days.
Discharge from hospital to their home with rAAA .
Long-term survival in rAAA is equal to or slightly lower than in the general population .
The IMPROVE trial investigators have recently presented 3-year clinical outcome from the UK trial with a three-year mortality after open repair of 54 versus 42% after endovascular repair.
Age at time of presentation is a strong predictor of longterm survival in rAAA.
Surgical reintervention rate in open repair after 30 days .
Open group: 3.9% in the open group, similar to our findings.
In the present study, only one patient was treated for a paraanastomotic aneurysm , and it seems reasonable to state that this is an underestimate.
Aneurysm-related mortality later than 30 days postoperatively was 7%, mainly due to deaths from complications directly related to the surgery in a prolonged post-operative period.
The IMPROVE trial reported an aneurysm-related cause of death in 4.4% of patients.
RAAA can be directly related to the prior surgical treatment of rAAA.
A Norwegian study from the early 1980s reported that cardiovascular disease was the cause of death in 50% of all deaths after surgery for rAAA.
An epidemiologically well-defined population and the long follow-up time of this study are a strength compared to similar studies on outcome after rAAA repair.
The study population is limited and only one patient was treated with rEVAR as this procedure was generally not available in the institution.
Long-term survival after surgery for rAAA was good and comparable to the survival of an age-and sex-matched population.

None of the three studies evaluating patient-level interventions, including two RCTs contributing high-quality evidence, showed improvement in ART adherence and viral suppression.
Text messaging did not serve as a daily reminder for taking ART medication .
Adolescents and youth with HIV are less likely to remain clinically stable.
The concept of 'stable' adolescents and youth may be misleading.
Home-based case management interventions, which provided additional counseling to identify and address specific barriers which may not be recognized in the clinical setting, showed improved adherence and viral suppression outcomes.
Family and social isolation, structural challenges, clinic-based care, and poor provider relationship .
 ART adherence was ascertained through self-report which may be subject to social desirability bias artificially leading to a positive effect.
A new HIV treatment that is available in more developed or easier-to-access locations.
An additional limitation is the inability to identify adolescents and youth who have adequate ART adherence but are not virally suppressed, likely because of the presence of ART drug resistance.
Drugs prescribed could begin to address this limitation since research shows certain regimens are more likely to produce resistance.
Interventions using social media or smart phone applications can be feasibly adapted for use in resource-limited settings.
Medication-related barriers-side-effects and ease of daily dosing-are critical aspects of adherence and require simplification.
Services interventions could significantly and sustainably impact adolescent and youth ART adherence.

A study on the effect of a single dose of a drug on a person's survival .
A multivariable analysis identified the usual predictors of 30-day outcome .
A large prospective study of non-scheduled, acute ICU admissions provides important information.
Age-related symptoms as frailty, cognitive decline and disability were strongly associated with 30-day mortality and were more important than age alone.
Frailty remains independent of ICU and 30 days mortality in elderly ICU patients.
Frail patients report reduced quality of life both in the physical and mental subset of EuroQol Health Questionnaire and in the SF-12.

No-informed consent and pre-ICU triage .
CFS scores can be reliably assigned retrospectively and can be generated using medical chart review.
Inter-rater was excellent in our study with a weighted kappa above 0.8.
We focused on mortality but other outcomes such as long-term ventilation, chronic critical illness and cognitive dysfunction should also be assessed in future studies.
Clinical frailty scale alone was an independent prognostic factor for 1-month survival after ICU admission.

The study was approved by the Comité de Protection des Personnes and registered with clinicaltrials.gov .
BALs performed without bronchoscopy and BAL without cellular analysis by a pathologist.
We planned to include 500 patients and BALs .
Data were recorded using paper case report forms filled in by local investigators and/or study nurses and then digitalized in the coordinating center .

Not statistically different between intubated and non-intubated patients at time of BAL or between patients with BAL performed only for suspicion of hospital-acquired lung infection .
The quality of the BAL fluid collected was not statistically associated with the BAL usefulness.
SpO 2 values are lower in the standard oxygen group than in the other types of respiratory support.
BAL is satisfactory for suspicion of hospital-acquired lung infection, case where BAL fluid quality might have less importance since most often mainly microbiological information is expected.
Only 4 of 49 non-intubated patients with the most severe respiratory failure had BAL performed under NIV, while the remaining patients had HFNC therapy.
The high frequency of adverse events collected in this study could be due to differences in methods used for collecting and defining adverse events.
Intubating the sickest patients in non-ventilated ICUs is safer than intubating those who do not .
The present study highlights the importance of the physician's experience and training, which have often been emphasized in recommendations for bronchoscopy but have never been demonstrated for BAL so far.
Experienced physician is a strong predictor of BAL of good quality.
We found that the BAL input for decision making is not easily predictable.
The number of adverse events brought about by open lung biopsy is rather low compared to other diagnostic, invasive procedures.
Open lung biopsy for immunosuppressed patients .
This study has several limitations, because we did not study any control group in parallel, the adverse events collected cannot be attributed to bronchoscopy or to the BAL with certainty.
In real-life conditions, adverse events possibly related to the BAL procedure, of which anesthesia is an integral part .
We used a home-made classification of the BAL input for decision making, which may have introduced bias.
In the estimation of the diagnostic yield of BAL, it is possible that the culture of the BAL fluid identified a microorganism already identified by other means and did not lead to modification of the antibiotic regimen already in place.
BAL was classified as Class 5 by the attending intensivists, because BAL not only has allowed ruling out some diagnoses, but also allowed trying another treatment such as diuretics or corticosteroids.
The lack of experience of the physician performing the BAL was identified as the main predictor of clinically significant adverse events in non-intubated patients.

Underinvestment in healthcare in sub-Saharan Africa threatens to derail the region's capacity to unlock its long-term economic growth potential.
A paradox within the neoliberal context: the rise of neoliberalism has radically affected people's experiences of engaging with the healthcare sector.
The paper is premised on Mushkin's health-led growth hypothesis, which, in essence, argues that health in itself is a form of capital, and investment in healthcare can boost human capital, providing a catalytic effect to overall economic growth.

Scans of the thoracic spine using axial and coronal reformations and sagittal short tau inversion recovery sequences .
A hospital's CPT abstracted clinical data from the medical record, and two radiologists reviewed the anonymized spine MRIs and recorded findings by consensus.
 Variables included patient demographics ; likelihood of abuse ; whether the child received an MRI of the spine and whether the imaging was of the whole spine or cervical spine only; injury severity , neurosurgical intervention, and mortality.
Initial mental status was recorded from the first available physical exam pertaining to the abuse concern.
Cranial injuries from contact or noncontact mechanisms .
We classified children with hypoxic-ischemic injury but no intracranial hemorrhage as "undetermined" and those without intracronial injury confirmed on MRI as "no head injury."

Traction on spinal nerve roots during hyperflexion/extension from shaking .
Spinal SDH is caused by intracranial hemorrhage, regardless of the presence of other spinal injuries.
Children with AHT are more likely to suffer spinal injury than those who do not.
Spinal SDH, other injuries typical of rotational acceleration/deceleration of the head, and a diagnosis of AHT in our subjects supports this theory.
AHT likelihood was compared to a second classification method developed by Duhaime et al.
Using the weighted kappa statistic, abuse classifications determined by the modified Duhaime criteria and Lindberg scale were significantly correlated.
Spinal injury in abused children and children with higher severity of injury was more likely to receive a spine MRI, potentially causing under-detection of spinal injury.
An injury rate of 33% is not bad, but the number of injuries is too high.
We did not assess inter-and intraobserver variability in radiologists' readings of the spine MRIs, our ability to comment on the validity of the interpretations.
Spinal SDH was associated with AHT and with other head injuries typical of a rotational acceleration/deceleration injury mechanism.

A combination of severe injuries and complications, most likely contribute to the high inhospital mortality.
Autopsies for polytraumatised people are not routinely performed because of cultural believes in our country.
Acute care for patients with SCI in FYROM is mainly centralized to TOARILUC.
TOARILUC is the only public hospital treating tSCI.
The ISNCSCI assessments, all the clinical examinations and interviews were carried out by one person only an experienced clinician with proper training.
A limitation of our study is the small number of participants, and thus the yearly incidence of traumatic SCI may be underreported.
We have outlined the tSCI patient's way from the scene of accident throughout the acute phase to the rehabilitation phase in FYROM.
We found a high in-hospital mortality rate for SCI patients, probably due to underreported deaths.
Polytrauma among SCI patients after discharge from acute hospital is 32%, most likely due to high degree of polytrauma.
Data sets generated and analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.

Understanding the context in which implementation occurs can shed light on the implementation outcomes.
Exploring the experience of the early adopters can help to identify the facilitators and barriers to implementation.
A Type A FLS for Hip Fracture Prevention in Alberta.
We assessed the early adopter sites to understand the context in which the FLS was implemented, including readiness to implement change as well as facilitators and barriers to implementation.
We conducted a qualitative contextual assessment of FLS as it unfolded naturally at two early adopter sites.
We used purposeful and snowball sampling to identify key informants with knowledge of the implementation and/or a clinical role in the FLS at the provincial level and at the two sites.
Organizational Readiness for Implementing Change using a 5-point Likert scale .
Interviews using semi-structured interview guides at baseline and post-implementation .
We used thematic analysis to analyze the data. We conducted data collection and analysis until thematic saturation was achieved.
Organizational Readiness for Implementing Change through the FLS .
We conducted 20 baseline interviews between July 2015 and January 2016, and 13 post-implementation interviews.
The FLS was implemented using several strategies that were essential to implementation success, particularly in the context of change fatigue.
We provide a list of codes, sub-codes, and additional quotes for each statement in Table 2 .
The FLS was implemented at the two sites through the use of strategies that were vital to successful implementation, particularly within the context of reported change fatigue.
This is an additional program and additional step…people are willing to come on board and be enthusiastic.
A key strategy was providing the resources needed to implement the FLS, thereby not increasing the existing workload of others.
A non-invasive program that's easy to use .
Role confusion at baseline, site selection for FLS, workload and coverage.
An early adopter site that is open to change and willing to look at something .
Learning from previous experiences with change and applying those learnings to the implementation of the FLS.
From site selection to the fact that we're doing a staged roll out, through to how we communicate, how we engage with our stakeholders, or how we even organized the content development and delivery of this program .
Change fatigue is not a barrier to implementing the FLS, and strategies outlined above as the rationale for this opinion.
FLS has had good support from a leadership perspective across the province and I think people would be accepting of a new service like FLS .

A little bit back to their normal self, maybe they can make some of these decisions .
A look at some of the key points of the report.
A clear understanding of the intent of the FLS related to the 3i model of "Identify" eligible patients, "Investigate," and "Initiate" treatment, mainly medication, with the purpose of secondary prevention of fractures or falls.
Communication of the occurrence of a fracture and the tests and treatments initiated as being of potential benefit to the patient's continuing care.
A patient has a hip fracture and we send them a letter saying we've started this medication, we've done these investigations, and then they're left wondering what to do.
The FLS has expanded beyond the 3i model to include identification of geriatric syndromes and referral to additional services .
We decided to make ours a little bit broader in the sense that we didn't want it just to be a medication type program.
We added a geriatric component, and we added geriatric people .
The FLS is aligned with organizational values including providing patientcentered care and using a collaborative or multi-disciplinary approach.
We work together collaboratively to try to make sure that we are placing all of our patients on the right .

An intimate exam when they are, for example, undergoing a cardiac procedure, should be made explicit to the patient.
The design of the consent form matters, and the form should be modified to document explicit consent.
The explicit consent policy should be publicly available and easily accessible so that all interested parties, including legislators and members of the general public, can locate and have confidence in its existence.
Communications between physician and medical student also matter.

Smokers and Non-Smokers in Trauma .
Cigarette smoking worsens the lung's healing ability and predisposes it to injury following an inciting event.
A low incidence of ARDS in the adolescent trauma population, with all cases occurring in smokers.
Younger patients with ARDS and associated mortality in younger patients is due to greater capacity for repair, and altered cytokine burden.
Smoking increases the risk of inflammatory and infectious complications in trauma patients.
Adolescent smoking trauma patients have an increased risk of pneumonia and hospital LOS.
Smoking has no effect on survival in adolescent trauma patients and the only two complications that are increased are pneumonia and an unplanned return to the operating room.
A significant limitation is that 538 patients did not fit into our propensity-matched model and thus, were excluded from the analysis.
The TQIP database provides limited information on smoking history and pulmonary functional status, and given that smoking is a selfreported variable, the incidence is significantly underreported.
The TQIP database does not contain data on smoking among young people with Trauma.
A 3-year review of the TQIP database, 3.1% of adolescent trauma patients were found to be smokers.
Early diagnosis and treatment can reduce morbidity like the increased LOS observed in this study.
Funding This research did not receive any specific grant agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.
Ethical approval This research involved humans, and since this retrospective study was performed using a national database with deidentified patients, risk to participants is minimal.

 APRV in rescue mode, 23 patients were able to be discharged with spontaneous breathing, two patients developed pulmonary damage, so NIV was set and they were discharged home with NIV.
 APRV can be considered a safe ventilation method for children.
 APRV as a primary ventilation strategy in children with ARDS resulted in higher mortality rates compared with conventional low tidal volume ventilation.
A retrospective observational study, conducted with the intent of describing the outcomes of patients with severe ARDS refractory to CMV, who were then treated with APRV.
S sedation is not required for analgesia and analgesia is not needed.
 APRV is associated with a significant and sustained improvement in oxygenation and may be considered as an alternative rescue mechanical ventilation mode in pediatric ARDS patients refractory to conventional ventilation.

QOL can refer to two distinct, if overlapping, entities.
A 1996 landmark study in the New England Journal of Medicine conceptualized QOL in terms of multidimensional domains, including social, physical, and psychological, as understood through individual experiences, perceptions, and beliefs.
The PedsQL Infant Scales deal only with current health status and expected newborn milestones, rather than long-term medical, psychological, and social/emotional sequelae.
A gap in the data exists, particularly as it relates to the explicit delineation of factors that are and should be incorporated into otherwise subjective clinical evaluations of the overall QOL of neonatal patients.
We explore the feasibility of developing a standardized definition for clinical use .

Doctors are more likely than parents to tolerate future surgery and need for a tracheostomy.
An infant can have any number of disabilities and still have a "good" QOL .
Lack of "family" , lack of "love" , and the inability to "communicate" are contributory to a "bad" QOL.

Wereszczak et al. observed parental distress by the perceived pain that infants sustained during standard clinical practice in the NICU .
We do things to babies that are uncomfortable, painful, stressful, and it's acceptable to make those interventions to cause that pain and discomfort.
A key divergence was found in the interpretations of long-term health outcomes.
In the NICU, parents believe that extensive disabilities do not preclude a good QOL for babies .
None of these are reasons to think your child would have a bad QOL.
Parents in the NICU are often encountering these situations for the first time, and most have no formal education in the science underlying the care of infants.

Health-related QOL for those who survived to young adulthood is not related to size at birth or disability .
A limitation to this study is the demographics of the familial participant population, namely that family participants in the survey were primarily white and female.
Empirical studies focused on mothers only do not achieve racial and ethnic diversity .
QOL cannot be adequately defined for standardized use in a clinical context, and as such, should be used thoughtfully by

The Full Outline of UnResponsiveness score does not rely on verbal assessment and includes a detailed assessment of brainstem function .
Automated infrared pupillometry using handheld device allows objective and quantitative measurement of pupillary function .
Automatic pupillometry in a neuro-ICU setting.
We dichotomized patients according to their pupillary function; i.e. patients who at least once had one or two non-responsive pupils were allocated to one group and the remaining patients to the other.
Clinical outcome was evaluated 6 months after admission, based on notes from electronic patient charts, using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended .
We did two systematic searches of PubMed and MEDLINE with publications from 2005 and forward.
Data handling and statistical analyses were done using R ( Vienna, Austria).
Fifty-six patients were assessed a median of five times . Nineteen of the patients achieved a favourable outcome .
Favourable outcome for patients with GCS 7-14 according to FOUR score .
Automated pupillometry confirms absence of pupillary constriction .
Automated Pupillometry for Pupil Constriction .
Automated pupillometry and FOUR score for frequent bedside monitoring in the ICU.
A GCS score of 3 is considered less predictive of outcome .
The FOUR score allows for a more granular classification of patients with severely impaired consciousness levels.
The validity of the FOUR score renders it a good predictor of patient outcome.
No patient with a FOUR score had a favourable outcome, while having a GCS of 3 was comparable with the rest of the cohort .
We went further and frequently repeated assessments which allow us to conclude that more information can be obtained with repeated FOUR scores in patients with the lowest level of consciousness.
Visual inspection slightly underestimates pupillary size compared to automated pupillometry.
Pupil constriction is sometimes revealed by pupillary function. Reliable estimations of pupillary size and contractibility are therefore needed.
Automated pupillometry can reveal pupillary constriction below 0.1 mm , although the additional prognostic value in this study appeared relatively limited.
Automated pupillometry provides quantitative information on pupillary constriction, dilation velocity and pupillary diameters .
Automated pupillometry over visual evaluation of pupillary size in the neuro-ICU .

Automated pupillometry allows for finer quantification of pupillary function.
Tracheostomy can facilitate weaning in long-term ventilated patients, potentially shortening the duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit stay, and reducing complications from prolonged tracheal intubation.
The tracheostomy is a complex and complex procedure, and its use is uncertain.

Pre-injury factors, pre-hospital care, clinical care, post-acute care, and outcome .
Towards a better understanding of tracheostomy in TBI patients.
Early tracheostomy after TBI is associated with shorter ICU length of stay and with a trend of a better outcome.
The Glasgow Outcome Score (GOSE) was used to assess patients' functional outcome at 6 months after injury .
Continuous variables are described with median and interquartile range , or mean and standard deviation , as appropriate, and categorical data are reported as absolute and relative frequencies.
A Cox regression model was used to identify the key factors that affected the decision and timing of tracheostomy during ICU stay.
Time dependence of effects using the Schoenfeld test and Martingale residuals .
Country- and centre-specific incidence rate of late, early, and no tracheostomy .

Towards tracheostomy in ICU .
Age had a statistically significant impact on the hazard of tracheostomy .
Time and HR estimates indicate that patients with at least one unreactive pupil have a higher hazard as compared to those with both reacting pupils.
We observed a considerable heterogeneity among countries in the decision to perform a tracheostomy and in the timing for truceostomy .
We used the MOR to quantify between-centre differences and found that even after correction for patient characteristics, there was a 2.2-fold difference in the odds of tracheostomy.
Late tracheostomy in Model 1 is associated with a 6% increase in the hazard of mortality .
The results of a study on the effect of training on memory and attention .
Tracheostomy is commonly performed in TBI patients in ICU, and is most frequently undertaken after the first week.
We found that tracheostomy was frequent amongst TBI patients in the ICU.
Tracheostomy for TBI patients in the first 14 days from admission.
The median time to tracheostomy was 9 days post-admission.
Tracheostomy in TBI patients with rapidly progressive injuries .
Between-country and between-centre differences in the incidence and timing of tracheostomy .
Early tracheostomy may potentially reduce hospital stay, duration of mechanical ventilation and mortality rates .
Early tracheostomy does not affect mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, and LOS.
An increase of 1 day in tracheostomy timing was significantly associated with the risk of an unfavourable outcome with a 6% increase in the hazard of death.
Late tracheostomy leads to longer mean LOS in ICU and in hospital .
Unidentified residual confounders may have affected our analyses.
Tracheostomy in patients with TBI is associated with increased LOS and worse functional neurological outcome, but the causality is unproven.

A recent study demonstrated that prehospital serum lactate levels were predictive of the need for resuscitative care in normotensive patients with trauma.
FAST, a component of several scores including FAS-ILA, is used to detect the presence of hemoperitoneum and pericardial effusion in cases of trauma.
The FASILA score is easy to use and calculate, and may alert clinicians of the possibility of death in the absence of MTP activation.
The present study had the inherent limitations of all retrospective and single-center studies. In addition, patients with trauma who died before arrival at hospital, or presented to the ED with cardiac arrest, were not included.
We did not include severely injured patients who die or stop bleeding with less than 10 units of RBCs, but certainly qualify.
FASILA was tested against other scoring systems but not against ''clinical gestalt'' alone.
We plan to prospectively utilizing this score with development of a bedside app to perform this calculation on spot.
The FASILA score is a novel, simple, feasible, and easy-toremember tool that predicts the need for blood transfusion, MTP activation, and the risk of mortality in patients with abdominal trauma.
Oncologists are exposed to a lot of suffering, dying, and death .
Compassion fatigue is a state of tension, which can develop among professional caregivers in response to witnessing the suffering of others.
A theoretical model conceptualizing compassion fatigue as a negative aspect of working in the helping professions and compassion satisfaction as a positive aspect.
Compassion fatigue and compassion satisfaction can coexist .
Compassion fatigue is a condition in which physicians withdraw from patients as the patient moves closer to death .
Oncologists in the United States are more likely to be diagnosed with cancer than the general population.
We examined whether grief and a sense of failure regarding the oncologist's own professional work affected compassion fatigue and compassion satisfaction.
Grief is experienced by oncologists in response to the loss of a patient who has touched them in some particular way or who has reminded them of the reasons they chose to go into their profession.
Oncologists' grief includes, besides sorrow, feelings of powerlessness, self-doubt, and guilt .
Oncologists' grief has not been, to the best of our knowledge, quantitatively examined.
A sense of failure among physicians, and among oncologists in particular, has rarely been documented.
In this survey, out of the 598 American oncologists who responded, 56% reported experiencing burnout symptoms.
We explored whether grief over patients and sense of failure affected these outcomes beyond the oncologists' reported exposure to death and suffering.

Oncologists may need to be "touched" by suffering and deaths they are exposed to in order to develop compassion fatigue symptoms.
Caregiving burden predicts caregivers' depression among advanced cancer patients .
Compassion fatigue is a result of secondary exposure to others' traumatic experiences .
Oncologists develop compassion fatigue in response to their primary exposure to the trauma of repeated loss and perceived failure.
Compassion fatigue does not prevent oncologists from experiencing compassion satisfaction.
We found that compassion satisfaction is more associated with resilience factors and coping mechanisms than with negative feelings such as grief and sense of failure .
We found no association between seniority and levels of compassion fatigue or satisfaction.
Psychological interventions with oncologists at the level of their subjective experience might be beneficial.

VAP is the only independent predictor of ARDS in patient without chest injuries.
In this series of 9873 trauma patients admitted to the ICU, the development of moderate-to-severe ARDS was relatively uncommon with an incidence of 2%.
Trauma-associated ARDS is different, both clinically and biologically, from that caused by the other clinical disorders . Given this fact, there could be distinct forms of ARDS even within the post-traumatic population .
Post-traumatic Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome .
An independent predictor of ARDS for subgroup without chest injury.
A subset of ARDS patients without chest injury sustained no thoracic trauma on admission, and, therefore, had significantly higher mortality compared to those patients with chest injury.
VAP cannot account for the mortality difference between those ARDS patients with and without chest injury.
 ventilator bundle is not associated with VAP prevention .
ARDS is a different entity in trauma patients without chest injury.
Better prognosis if ARDS were to develop.
The retrospective design of this study precludes the exclusion of selection bias and unevaluated differences as potential confounding variables.

A study on the effects of mechanical ventilation on chronic respiratory failure.
The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to compare the actual duration of the SBT trial to the duration of spontaneous breathing in the outpatient setting, as well as to that recommended by the physician at the last in-patient check-up session.
Ventilated subjects with cardiovascular comorbidities in a pressure-controlled mode .
The first 30 min of the SBT did not fulfil any failure criterion, and the last 30 minutes did not meet any failure criteria.
Weaned from invasive mechanical ventilation after the first 30 min .
Eight subjects terminated the SBT after ≤30 min and seven subjects after >30 min , irrespective of the failure criteria being fulfilled or not.
Group 1 and 2 were comparable in terms of the following pre-SBT parameters: PaCO2 , pH , systolic blood pressure , VAS score for dyspnoea , fear and pain .
RSBI measurementsshowed values greater than 105 breaths/min/l from the very start of the whole trial and she insisted on continuing with spontaneous breathing.
The mean duration of the spontaneous breathing period recommended by the physician was 2.0 h/day .
The SBT-which was originally transferred from an ICU setting to subjects with prolonged weaning-may therefore not be useful in this patient cohort.
Weaning patients with chronic respiratory failure respond differently to the physiological parameters covered by the SBT.
Rapid shallow breathing improves RS-BI in ICU medicine.
The RSBI is the best index for evaluating the SBT, although it has a variable specificity and several trials observed a wide range of different predictive values.
An elevated RSBI was the first failure criterion to be met within the SBT in this trial, which further supports the thesis that patients in prolonged weaning differ from intubated patients in the ICU.
The RSBI does not seem to be an adequate proxy for SBT failure in prolonged-weaning patients.
Clinical assessment is more useful than following the rigid failure criteria for the SBT.
Weaning failure severity can be determined independent of the SBT .
The current study doubts that the SBT-as recommended by guidelines-is a worthwhile tool for predicting spontaneous breathing capabilities in prolonged, unsuccessful weaning.
This study is a strictly observational trial in which statistical data serve as exploratory and descriptive findings only.
SBT is prone to both over-and underestimation of the ability to breathe spontaneously in patients with prolonged, unsuccessful weaning.

Higher daily doses, preceded by LD, should be considered for pathogens with higher MICs .
AUC-based TDM with at least one sample collected combined with Bayesian dose adaptation has been suggested to optimise polymyxin B dosing in critically ill patients .

Taking a deep breath and reseating oneself, then returning attention to the breath.
We believed that meditation practices can be applied to PTSD-relevant experiences, so homework was designed to encourage and help trouble-shoot that process.
Adaptation to 8th grade reading level and Veteran-relevant terminology were important to foster accessibility of the material.
We were concerned that the group nature of the intervention, which is the standard for instruction in meditation, could create a barrier to individuals who typically prefer one-on-one therapy.
Learning meditation rather than discussing traumatic events will facilitate one's ability to discuss and cope with distressing experiences, such as during trauma-focused psychotherapy.

A Qualitative Interview for CM for Women in their 30s .
A semistructured interview guide posed nine reflective questions that focused around the experience of practicing CM, potential changes noted from skills they had learned at each intervention session, and personal changes that participants perceived in managing both pleasant and unpleasant situations.
Weekly measures of mental health, emotional experience, and alcohol consumption were used to measure clinical outcomes.
The sample description and analysis of clinical change is based on data that were pooled across four groups of six to eight participants.
The qualitative data provided a contextual understanding of differences in participants' reactions and how that influenced their adaptability to the dynamics of the intervention.
A pilot study on the impact of PTSD on drinking habits .
Eighty-eight percent of those who were assessed for eligibility enrolled in the study; this high rate likely reflects the use of clinician referral and relatively broad eligibility requirements.
Completers did not receive a meaningful introduction to the practice and, although they were asked to provide data at the end, none of them did so.
Credibility questions were rated on an 8-point scale, with higher numbers indicating greater credibility.
This week was the longest week of the season so far .
Sessions were reconfigured to allow for additional discussion time because several participants were dissatisfied with the way that time was divided among presentation of new material, discussion, and practiced meditation.
Change from the first to last session attended, were partial eta squared of .27 for PTSD and.19 for depression.
Towards the end of the study, we identified a number of areas where we can improve.

CM increases positive emotion, which is not consistent with what we observed in our Sessions 9 and 10.
The Circumplex Measure of Emotion, used in the circumplex model of emotions , may be helpful in better understanding the emotional impact of CM.
Change in positive and negative emotions over the period of the group.
Social connectedness reflects one's social network; once attitudes about others change, it likely takes time additional time to change one's relationships.
We found that the first 3 weeks when meditation was being taught but the contemplative work about compassion had yet to be presented.
Improving the ability to act with awareness could lead to a reduction in PTSD symptoms.
We found large effect size changes in symptomatology, but a randomized trial is needed before drawing conclusions.
The nonrandomized design of this study leaves open the possibility that observed changes are due to other factors, such as the passage of time, social support or nonspecific aspects of the intervention.
The treatment manual was modified over the course of this study, so the results reflect application of the general approach rather than application of a manualized approach.

Assisted mechanical ventilation for critically ill patients, particularly when the acute phase is resolving and the patient needs to be weaned from the ventilator .
Inspiratory muscles and the diaphragm .
Estimation of inspiratory effort during assisted ventilation using Pmus/EAdi index .
The PEI measured during occlusion is highly correlated with the PEI during assisted ventilation and could be used to convert the EAdi signal into a continuous Pmus signal .
We hypothesize that it is possible to calculate PEI over a brief airway occlusion without the need for a full patient's inspiratory effort.
A cohort of acute respiratory failure adult patients admitted to our intensive care unit who were intubated and undergoing assisted mechanical ventilation with PEEP > 5 cmH 2 O were included.
The EAdi signal was measured by an esophageal NAVA catheter .
Keep pressed until the patients completed an entire inspiratory effort, seen on the airway waveform as a negative deflection and a return towards the set peep value.
We analyzed the recorded traces offline by the aforementioned waveform analysis software.
We identified the physiological variability of the Paw waveform during expiration in the 1-s period before the end-expiratory occlusion.
We analyzed the variance of PEI values of the entire study population obtained at 100 and 200 ms by 0.05-µV intervals of ΔEAdi.
Systemic error and the 95% limits of agreement as bias .
We analyzed 443 end-expiratory occlusions from the 12 patients enrolled, ranging from 31 to 53 Occlusions per patient.
In this paper, I propose a new term for PEI, PEI occl .
 PEI 0.2 was fairly related to the measured PEI occl , as shown by the Bland-Altman plot .
Paw deflection without relevant increase of EAdi .
The EAdi signal records the activity of the diaphragm, which is not the only inspiratory muscle; in theory, if the patients would inspire using only the accessory muscles, the Eadi signal would be flat.
Muscles rather than activation of the diaphragm caused insufficient ΔEAdi for PEI calculation .
 PEI 0.2 tended to overestimate PEI occl , therefore we suggest to implement a correcting factor to improve agreement.
35% could be considered acceptable: translated into practice, Pmus estimation error for a patient with PEI = 1 and EAdi peak = 5 µV would be lower than 2 cmH 2 O.
Automated PEI 0.2 Measurement of End-expiratory Occlusion with Pmus Trace Estimation .
Low level of effort in the acute phase to prevent alveolar overdistension and a higher level during the weaning phase to preventing diaphragm atrophy.
Pmus estimation could not be accurate in some patients, such as severe COPD patients who were excluded from our study to limit confounding factors.
Automated and repeated brief airway occlusions performed by the ventilator could provide a real time measurement of PEI with little to no discomfort for the patient.
Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study, according to the Institutional Ethical Committee recommendations.
Ethical procedures performed in studies involving human participants and/or animals.
Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura risk increases after measles, rubella, chickenpox and influenza infection .
Evidence suggests that ITP risk after vaccination increases through the same mechanism as that by which microbial infections induce antiplatelet autoantibodies .
A combined vaccine is a single product in which equivalent component vaccines are administered as a single vaccine to prevent more than one disease or to protect against multiple strains of infectious microbes .
Simultaneous vaccination is defined as administering more than one vaccine at different anatomic sites .
Risks may accumulate in simultaneous vaccination, but no research has compared the risks when administering vaccines simultaneously versus separately.
Rates of adverse reactions are similar between simultaneous and separate vaccine administration .
In this case-control study, we aimed to determine the ITP risk after live, inactivated and simultaneous vaccination in Japan.
We requested physicians from paediatrics and internal medicine departments at seven universities and 18 regional centre hospitals in Japan to recruit inpatients and outpatients for this study.
We defined exposure as vaccination within 28 days before the onset of ITP.
We considered ≤ 28 days after administration as the duration in which vaccinated people could potentially develop ITP as a result of vaccination.

We investigated children aged 2 months to 11 years: six children had two vaccines, four had three vaccines, two had four vaccines and one had five vaccines.
The McNemar's and common ORs for ITP occurrence for all, live and inactivated vaccines ranged from almost null to more than 1 among people of all ages, children aged < 18 years and children aged 2 years.
A study of MMR-associated acute ITP in combination with genetic predisposition .
A postlicensure retrospective study in the United States did not find any ITP cases among 2-month-old infants vaccinated with the DTaP-IPV/Hib vaccine from 1 October 2008 to 31 July 2010 .
An Italian post-licensure prospective study reported 13 cases of thrombocytopenia after seasonal influenza vaccinations .
 McNemar's ORs for inactivated vaccines varied from under 1 to over 1, and were not statistically significant in the examined age groups.
In Japan, many inactivated vaccinations are scheduled for children aged < 1 year , meaning that infants of this age have a high chance of being immunised with inactivated vaccines.
This study did not detect ITP risk in inactivated vaccination.
Vaccination has three types of benefits: direct effects , indirect effects and reduction in the risk for developing ITP caused by infection with viruses or bacteria.
Infection caused by MMR vaccination is 10-20 times lower than the incidence of ITP following natural infection .
A randomised controlled trial involving people receiving simultaneous influenza vaccination reported increased haemagglutinin inhibition titre, seroconversion and seropositivity rates, suggesting that the immune response was boosted .
The risk of ITP with simultaneous vaccination compared with separate vaccination may increase depending on the administration method.
The study was underpowered because we adopted a matched design to adjust for several confounders between cases and controls.
A national surveillance system of adverse events following vaccinations in Japan is needed in an era when people are concerned about drug-induced diseases.
We chose a design to counter the limitation of factors in selecting potential control patients, we chose to counter this limitation.
The use of physician-registered cases enhanced the internal validity of this investigation, suggesting relatively high external validity.

PICU being attended by a pediatric intensivist improves the quality of care.
The first PICU fellowship in Turkey was appointed to a hospital of Ministry of Health.
In this study authors evaluated the effect of pediatric intensivist on the process of care and PICU outcomes.
A retrospective cohort study of PICU patients in a Turkish hospital with a pediatric residency program.
PICU admissions from January 2013 through January 2017 were included in the study.
Cardiac patients were managed in the cardiac-PICU which was directed by the cardiac surgeons.
Staffing and structure of the PICU remained stable throughout the study period.
PICU team, including residents and nurses, started rounding minimum twice a day under the leadership of the pediatric intensivist.
On call for 24 h/day and remained available for any acute changes in patients, new admissions or need for revised plans.
Cardiac-PICU was also consulted by the pediatric intensivist and patients who were not extubated in the early post-operative period and patients requiring prolonged medical follow-up were transferred to PICU.
Towards a Comparative Study of Pediatric Intensive Care .
Mortality rate, SMR, number of admissions, length of stay, mechanical ventilator duration and number of nosocomial infections were compared between the two periods as primary outcome measures.
A general linear model was used to predict the effect of intensivist on the length of stay in PICU.

What transforms a unit full of critically ill patients to an intensive care unit is a dedicated intensivist.
Inhalational injury is responsible for 77% of all deaths following burn injury and is most often a consequence of carbon monoxide poisoning .
Inhalation injury in burn patients with significant airway involvement of their burn often develops direct mucosal injury to the respiratory tract, mucosal sloughing, and inflammation , potentially leading to airway obstruction and impaired gas exchange.
Higher fluid resuscitation requirements lead to an increased risk for pulmonary and airway oedema, acute respiratory distress syndrome , ventilator associated pneumonia and longer duration of mechanical ventilation and length of stay in the Intensive Care Unit .

Malaria remains one of the most devastating infectious diseases with 228 million malaria cases globally resulting in 405,000 deaths in 2018.
Malaria cases and deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa .
Malaria is caused by parasites of the Plasmodium genus and is transmitted to humans through bites of infected Anopheles mosquitoes.
Sporozoites invade a blood vessel, enter the blood stream and reach the liver.
Plasmodium falciparum induces cell death of hepatocyte and manipulates the hepatocyte membrane, leading to formation of parasite-filled vesicles containing hundreds of merozoites.
The ringstage stage is characterized by extensive parasite growth, sustained by ingestion of large amounts of haemoglobin and nutrients from blood plasma.
Lysis of erythrocyte and PV membranes in a protease-dependent process .
Mice migrate to salivary glands and are ready to be injected into the human host .
Clinical malaria is characterized by cyclic episodes of fever that are caused by synchronized rupture of infected erythrocytes, releasing large amounts of parasites and parasitederived molecules that induce a strong pro-inflammatory response.
Plasmodium parasites extensively remodel the erythrocyte and its plasma membrane by expressing a range of parasite-encoded proteins.
P. falciparum has been estimated to be older than 100,000 years resulting in an exquisite coadaption of both, the parasite and human host.
Different human populations and age groups are essential for detailed understanding of the intricate host-pathogen interaction.

Budesonide for BPD in Intubated ELGANs .
Our study design limited the number of infants studied at each dosing level. Also, concurrent controls were not included in the study design, for ethical reasons.
We decided not to continue enrolling the infants in this study after the first three dosage levels failed to show clinical benefit.
Treatment for BPD should require treatment over the biological period of risk to assess efficacy and safety in a fair way.
We do not support the "late" treatment of intubated ELGANs with a regimen of budesonide in surfactant at the three dosages we tested, but do provide important insights into blood budesonides concentrations, lung anti-inflammatory effects and potentially global metabolomics effects that are
We suggest that measurement of TA inflammatory mediators would be informative in future trials of PCS therapy.
One-tenth of budesonide dose in Data are sufficient to reduce inflammation with minimal systemic effects even with repeated treatment.
Lower doses of budesonide are needed for preventing BPD.

Post-hoc survival analyses showed that the placebo group during the 28 day follow-up period observed a significant difference in survival compared to the APACHE II group.
The number of observed deaths in both treatment groups was less than expected but the discrepancy was far greater in the placebo group.
Adverse Events in the methylnaltrexone Study .
Adding methylnaltrexone to regular laxatives has no additional benefit but the confidence interval is wide, consistent with there being between 18% less and two and a half times more chance of rescue free laxation.
Methylnaltrexone was well tolerated with no drug-related significant adverse effects, and no evidence of increased opioid requirements.
Methylnaltrexone has no beneficial effect in critical care.
A number of potential factors may account for our findings.
We found that the placebo group had a higher incidence of subsequent diarrhoea and passed more stools.
In this study, the presence of diabetes gastropathy and sedation and pain scores for the duration of the study may have provided additional valuable information.
The apparent excess of deaths in the methylnaltrexone arm is potentially concerning but appears to represent a lower than anticipated number of deaths.
An imbalance between the trial arms occurred by chance, owing to the relatively small trial size.
The study was double-blinded and placebo-controlled, randomisation was concealed, and measured patient-centred outcomes.
We found no evidence to support the addition of methylnaltrexone to regular laxatives for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation in critically ill patients.

Transgender women, particularly transgender women of color, in the U.S. face intersecting individual and structural challenges that result in increased vulnerability.
A lack of culturally responsive and gender affirming services, and past negative experiences of stigma and discrimination by health care providers influence their engagement in care.
A small number of HIV prevention group interventions have been implemented with transgender women regardless of their HIV status.
SISTA, an evidence-based, social skills-building, group-level intervention for transgender women .
Healthy Divas is a clinical trial currently being implemented to optimize engagement in HIV care for transgender women living with HIV.
In response to HIV disparities among TWOC, as part of the Transgender Women of Color initiative, the Health Resources and Services Administration funded nine demonstration projects at community-based organizations and/or medical settings in four U.S metropolitan areas to design and implement innovative theory-based interventions to engage TWOC in
Six interventions funded by the initiative provided drop-in, educational, community building, and/or support groups.
A multisite evaluation of nine interventions for HIV prevention in transgender people.
We examine the gender-affirming services and relationships that characterized the individual and/or group level interventions.
A Model of Gender Affirmation for Health Navigation Services .
Social gender affirmation is associated with greater personal competence, self-acceptance, and positive mental health outcomes.
Gender-affirming services may positively impact TWOC's perceptions of healthcare and contribute to their engagement and retention in HIV care.
Navigation services can improve engagement in HIV care and outcomes along the HIV care continuum across different populations and settings .
We conducted cross-sectional in-depth qualitative interviews with a purposive sample of participants in the interventions and of staff members implementing the interventions.
We conducted 67 interviews with 36 staff members implementing, and with 31 TWOC participating in the interventions.
We asked the sites to select a diverse sample of up to six TWOC participating in the interventions for us to interview, including participants who were newly diagnosed with HIV, participants who reengaged in HIV care during the interventions.
We conducted all interviews with TWOC intervention participants in person.
We asked participants about their experiences in the interventions, intervention services received, their life experiences and health seeking behaviors, and perceptions related to living with HIV and engagement in HIV care.
The Framework Analysis method used in health research informed our analysis.
We used Dedoose, a web application , to organize the data and facilitate analysis.
The first author coded the interviews conducted in Spanish. Second, the analysts applied those codes to the rest of the interview transcripts in English.
Intervention impact, intervention services, relationships part of the interventions, intervention messages, and transgender community.
We developed memos to summarize findings from interview excerpts under each code analyzed for this study, examine key themes, explore thematic relationships, and compare findings.
Interventions, barriers and facilitators to care among TWOC.
We identified convergent themes within and across sites, such as content of the services provided by the interventionists, gender affirmation, and the significance of the relationships developed during implementation of the interventions.
Diverse life experiences at the intersection of gender, socioeconomic class, racial and ethnic identity, self-presentation, and physical transition.
HIV/HIV-related discrimination, transphobic experiences, and personal violence and trauma.
The majority of interventionists that we interviewed were also TWOC , with an age range between their early twenties to their late fifties.
Interventionists and intervention participants were not necessarily matched by ethnicity, but Spanish-speaking staff worked with monolingual Latinas at the sites that mainly served English-speaking participants.
"They just want you to be well…from the receptionist to the janitorial staff, you never feel like you're not at home."
Intervention participants and staff often referred to transgender women as having low self-esteem and feeling defensive or socially excluded due to structural, interpersonal, and individual stigma.

Transgender community faces isolation and loneliness, once they know that they have a safe space, they are going to go…and when you are feeling better and you have support you tend to take care of your health.
A navigator emphasized the importance of maintaining a presence through interventions that are culturally appropriate and gender affirming, when she said:
"People are tired of being lectured about why they need to go into care."
A Latina participant in the intervention program at site D explained: Some did not like the "vibes," or what they described as "by the book," or "cut and dry" services.
We found that providing client-centered services that addressed basic, and many cases multiple, unmet needs was often the first step to engaging TWOC in HIV care.
Unocumented Latinas do not have access to health insurance or other government benefits, including housing options that preclude undocumented individuals from qualifying.
An interventionist in site C explained that multiple roles to provide services and address her clients' needs, many times causing frustration, compassion fatigue, or burnout among the implementing staff.
A "one stop shop" for developing personal skills and self-defense.
Interventionists provided one-on-one support to help link or reengage participants in HIV care.
A Latina participant explained that because transgender women are afraid of being mistreated when dealing with the health care system, it helped that the navigators could accompany them to appointments.
"It is like therapy, and that's very good."

A Latina interventionist with a stable job, living with HIV, well dressed, and seen as a role model: The socialization, self-management, and personal empowerment.
Sharing, sense of sisterhood, and learning from other participants' experiences in the educational, support, empowerment and community building intervention groups also contributed to provide emotional support.
A group of girls from a school for girls with disabilities, who are afraid of speaking in public, demand their rights.
Graduation certificates can be gender affirming and significant: for some, getting a certificate bearing her female name was the first time that somebody actually acknowledged on paper my female name.
A project director explained that it was challenging to find and retain TWOC in the intervention because of drug use, homelessness, or living in a context of poverty and a survival mode that included sex work.
Being engaged in other programs can help people survive for a couple nights.
Empirical footage of trans women working in the sex industry.
Relationships developed between interventionists and participants, among participants in intervention groups, and/or among participants and their peers in the community.
The interventionists established supportive relationships and developed trust, "confianza" for the Spanish-speaking Latina participants, and a sense of family or friendship with the participants.
A white cisgender navigator was able to establish meaningful relationships with transgender women, according to an African-American participant.
On the first day of training, I was a little skeptical: 'How is a female supposed to help navigate and advocate for me, a transsexual?'
A Latina participant observed: "I watch her handle and juggle all of these people, she has the patience of Job."
"I think I could to another program because I feel like those personal ties wouldn't be there with the girls."
Groups provided opportunities for socializing, sharing experiences, improve mutual trust, and feel supported by other participants.
Group ground rules often emphasized unity, communication and mutual respect and served to preempt "drama," or correct instances of giving attitude or "shade," or chismear, using the Spanish term for gossiping.
Word of mouth became an important strategy to recruit participants for the interventions at some sites, attesting to the acceptability of their services.
A Latina participant said: "I was like you, I was also scared like a puppy, but now I am more empowered, the doors are open, here they help us."
Improving Health Literacy for Complex Participant Needs .
Interventionists who were TWOC and/or living with HIV themselves became role models, mothers, sisters, or friends to participants.
Incorporating friendship networks and informal kinship relationships, intervention groups created a safe space that contributed to develop or enhance friendship networks.
We asked sites to include participants for the interviews not engaged in care or for whom the intervention had not worked well.
Engaged in medical care and, in general, spoke well of the interventions.

We will recruit a random sample of nurses, physicians, and RTs.
We will provide $50 incentives and schedule sessions at a time convenient to the participants.
Interviews on the implementation of the NIV protocol.
We expect to understand and identify barriers and facilitators and their relative importance for this implementation strategy to be the most successful.
We use directed qualitative content methods to analyze interview content, beginning with a coding framework based on our prior work.
A codebook will be used for all interviews going forward, with the team meeting periodically to discuss the emergence of any new codes or to clarify the relevance of domains and constructs.
The investigation will collect the following information to calculate the costs to initiate the intervention: cost of the training of the COPD-NIV team in the IPE arm of the study and inclusive of salary/fringe costs of the implementation specialists.
Premier Inc. will develop a toolkit and implementation manual to help other institutions implement the IPE strategy.
We found that IPE covered several of identified barriers, we found that using multiple strategies would complicate our attempt to understand the educational intervention impact.
We need to calculate hospitals' NIV rates and identify low performing hospitals to be able to invite them to participate in the trial and determine the rates after the implementation period.
IPE is a novel strategy for improving the NIV rates in hospitals.
This study will be among the first to carefully test the impact of IPE in the inpatient setting.

Vaccination is an efficient and cost-effective way to contain influenza epidemics and preserve public health.
The need for durable and broadly protective influenza vaccines .
Live attenuated influenza vaccines are made from coldadapted viruses that replicate well at body temperature and are administered intranasally.
The trivalent vaccine has viral components from two influenza A strains and one influenza B strain, whereas the quadrivalent vaccine formulations add an additional influenza B virus.
Infection vaccines can only contain a small number of modified proteins that can be incorporated into a vaccine.
B HA subtypes have differentiated into two serologically distinct lineages .
Viral structures for cross-reactive T cell responses .
To summarize: to basic scientists, regulators and vaccine manufacturers.
Influenza A viruses can be antigenically divided based on two key viral surface glycoproteins, HA and NA, whereas influenza B viruses form a single antigenic group with two distinct lineages.
This paper uses the haemagglutination inhibition inhibition antibody titre induced by the seasonal vaccines as an immune correlate of protection from influenza virus infection.

Antibodies against HA are a major component of the human immune response to both natural influenza virus infection and influenza vaccination, and measurement of antibody responses against HA by the HAI assay is the recognized correlate of protection.
HA is a type I membrane glycoprotein that forms a homotrimer that is typically glycosylated at between five and seven sites per monomer.
Comparison of influenza virus subtypes and types for glycosylation patterns.
H1N1 modifications can contribute to 'antigenic drift' of the virus 93, 94 .
Infection cells are often found following infection or immunization to provide durable protection against matched or closely-related viruses, but these antibodies tend to be strain-specific and do not neutralize drifted variants.
The C179 monoclonal antibody, isolated in mice, displayed unusually broad specificity and neutralized many group 1 HA viruses, including H1, H2, H5, H6 and H9 subtypes.
A new class of broadly neutralizing antibodies that cross-react with influenza A subtype viruses .
Stem-directed antibodies inhibit virus-like particle by fixing HA in its prefusion form .
Stem-directed human antibodies neutralize influenza strains within group 1 or group 2, but a few have been shown to neutralize across both groups.
The generation of broadly neutralizing antibodies by different vaccination platforms or immunogens in various animal models and in clinical trials has been demonstra ted.
Priming with a novel pandemic H5N1 or H7N9 DNA vaccine followed by matched-strain monovalent inactivated virus vaccine boost has improved the breadth of immune response in animals and in clinical trials.

Antibodies to conserved epitopes on the interface of the HA head trimer recognize a broad spectrum of influenza viruses and confer hetero-subtypic protection in mice.
In addition to harnessing and improving the humoral immune response to the HA antigen, universal influenza virus vaccines could potentially benefit from incorporating diverse and more highly-conserved antigens.
Neural neuraminidase inhibition activity predictive of susceptibility to live virus challenge .
Small-molecule inhibitors to NA can modulate disease severity 136 . Recent identification and characterization of broadly protective antibodies that recognize the active site of NA suggest that these antibodies could potentially be induced by vaccines.
Adding a known quantity of conformationally correct NA to current seasonal vaccines may improve efficacy and, potentially, breadth against drifted strains of influenza.

A large enterprise and standardized practices have been established to support the $1.6 billion US market and estimated $4 billion global market for influenza vaccines .
Viruses, vaccine viruses, and worldwide distribution 188 .
Vaccines make placebo-controlled trials difficult to justify in countries such as the United States.
Licensure of new seasonal vaccines is granted with evidence of efficacy obtained from past clinical trials with influenza illness as the primary end point, and approvals of annual supplements for new virus strains do not require additional clinical data.
Evaluating the efficacy of novel influenza vaccines may require giving the experimental vaccine in addition to conventional seasonal vaccine and determining whether efficacy is improved when circulating strains are mismatched.
Field trials could be designed to compare the candidate with licensed vaccines head-to-head.
HAI antibody titres are often used as a surrogate to extrapolate vaccine effectiveness, especially in vulnerable populations not included in the efficacy trials.
High strain-specific immunity can be detrimental, especially when trying to displace established products.
The use of HAI as a surrogate end point for achieving accelerated licensure is not an option.
neutralizing activity is likely to be an acceptable surrogate for protection, as HAI was originally developed as a surrogate for neutralization, which is the mechanistic correlate being assessed.
Continuous change in genetics and antigenicity of influenza viruses leads to the identification of antibody lineages associated with HA-stem-targeted broad neutralization of influenza strains across subtypes, and in some cases across groups.
Immunoglobulin genes from sorted B cells as clinical trial end points 28, 103, 198, 199 .
Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity an adaptive immune response by which specific antibodies bind to foreign antigens and, in turn, recruit effector cells to lyse target cells.

In this paper, we look at the impact of climate change on a range of people, from basic scientists, epidemiologists, regulators, manufacturers and the public.
Seasonal influenza vaccine production remains an enormous challenge for manufacturers as the vaccines must be produced and released 6 months after the WHO announces the vaccine strains for a given hemisphere.

The intersection of technological changes and social evolution has transformed every aspect of human life .
Understanding the relationship between contributions from HT and patient outcomes is a fundamental requirement for achieving optimal return on investment.
Healthcare systems are facing enormous challenges to manage its resources in the twenty-first century.
Health systems are structured around vertically-expert professions , but lack the "horizontal expertise" that trained Biomedical and Clinical Engineers provide.
Disproving the myth -that there is a lack of evidence to qualify how much the dependency of HT is well-guided by CE expertise and best practice methodologyled to our examination of published literature and formal presentations of case studies in which CEs, BEs, and those in similar roles have participated

Towards 90% of the general population will experience a criterion A traumatic event at some point in their lives .
Screening LGBTQ patients for trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms .
Patient-centered care begins with high-quality patient-provider communication .
Few providers have training in the unique needs of LGBTQ patients, which is essential for asking informed questions, establishing collaborative treatment plans, and engaging in the shared decision-making that makes patientcentered care possible .
In this review, we share some recommendations for working with LGBTQ patients with considerable focus on understanding the unique experiential and cultural factors, as well as disparities, relevant to the care and recovery of LGBTQ patients.
Social stressors can condition LGBTQ individuals to anticipate rejection from others, experience shame, and conceal their minority identity to prevent emotional pain, physical harm, or further trauma.
Intrusions, avoidance, negative alterations in cognition and mood, and hyperarousal.
Hyperarousal, and hypervigilance, has been observed following and in anticipation of discrimination .
A diagnosis of PTSD requires exposure to one or more criterion A trauma, as well as endorsement of persistent intrusive re-experiencing of the event .
Further research and clinical attention are needed to better understand and more effectively intervene to address the intersecting consequences of traumatic stress and minority stress.
In the meantime, as clinicians approach PTSD treatment among LGBTQ individuals, we believe it is essential to understand the psycho-social history within their respective social, environmental, political contexts.
Past Trauma and Minority Stress Experiences: Past trauma and minority stress experiences
In a recent study of trauma-exposed LGBTQ veterans, researchers conducted semi-structured interviews and found that experiences shared by these individuals fell into four unique yet overlapping categories.
Clinical attention including paranoia, hypervigilance, drug use, sexual risk taking, and heightened anxiety and depression.
We recommend approaching treatment in a manner that takes into account and respects LGBTQ individuals' previous experiences, as well as past and present context.
Adaptations observed in treatment represent intervention targets and which are adaptive strategies to cope with minority stress.
Improving patient-centered communication among trauma-exposed LGBTQ patients for optimal PTSD treatment outcomes .
Towards better treatment of trauma-exposed LGBTQ patients .
Clinician communication can buffer against disclosure apprehension in the context of previous discrimination .
Clinicians working with trauma-exposed LGBTQ patients can expand their traditional conceptualization of their role within a particular specialty or subfield to function as advocates for their patients, facilitating referrals, collaborating and consulting with interdisciplinary treatment teams.
Open dialogue about patients' LGBTQ identity and identity-related concerns .
A thoughtful approach to assessment and careful and accurate case conceptualization can aid in the provision of evidence-based care in the absence of established PTSD treatment guidelines for LGBTQ individuals.
We provide recommendations for screening and assessment tools to facilitate treatment planning in non-criterion A stressors.
Cognitive Behavioral "trauma-focused" therapies, such as prolonged exposure therapy ) and cognitive processing therapy ), have solid empirical support for use in the general population.
The efficacy of trauma-focused therapies or medication treatments in the context of concomitant stressors .
No empirical study has directly tested whether the efficacy of first-line PTSD treatments is moderated by sexual and/or gender minority identity, as no randomized controlled trials of PTSD treatment report the sexual or gender minority status of their sample.
We provide preliminary treatment recommendations based on anecdotal evidence and promote a broader discourse about the mechanisms, techniques, and assumptions that underlie, and can best advance, the treatment of PTSD among LGBTQ patients.
In this paper, we look at the role of medication-only providers in improving the quality of treatment.
A review of current best-practice interventions for PTSD .
Discomfort among trauma-exposed LGBTQ individuals may stem from more than life-threat experiences.
Identity-related adaptations to trauma exposure may uniquely impact how LGBTQ individuals manage identity disclosure and concealment, and may shape access to social resources, mental health outcomes, and health promoting behaviors relevant to PTSD onset and course .
Existing theories do not account for contexts in which chronic victimization experiences, elusive safety, or daily identity-based threats may influence or account for coping strategies and negative appraisals.
We would argue that to be clinically valid, any theory that operationalizes change agents in the treatment of PTSD among LGBTQ individuals must account for how the intervention targets these disparate phenomenologies.
Exposure-based procedures can be used to reduce problematic emotions and beliefs that maintain avoidance and limit access to social support.

Ranking the spectrum of antibiotics is complex and yields variable results depending on the method, the region and the priorities that are considered.
In the ward to allow oral treatment and discharge from hospital, and those regimens that cause additional emergence of resistance.
In silico PK/PD modeling has warned that narrower spectrum betalactams may have higher risks of non-target attainment than their broad-spectrum alternatives.
We recommend that a stop date and time is calculated from the time of effective treatment and that this is maintained for the treatment after ADE.
We recommend consideration is given to all or a combination of those reasons before deciding if narrowing the pivotal antimicrobial is the appropriate course of action in critically ill patients with a BSI.
Sufficient duration of antimicrobial therapy is required to prevent clinical failure and relapse.
We require at least one set of negative blood cultures obtained 2-4 days after the infection to define clearance of the bacteremia.
We learn that current practice consists in extended duration of treatment for those patients with a median of 14 days.
A shorter course of treatment artificially increases the risk of death associated with shorter courses.
A multicenter RCT involving 3598 ICU patients with BSI to 7 vs 14 days of antibiotics is ongoing .
The safety of shorter antibiotic therapy for Gramnegative uncomplicated BSI was recently shown in a RCT including 604 patients across 3 centers.
Short versus long antibiotic treatments in patients with bacteremia caused by the most common infectious syndromes .
Short treatment should safely be used for ventilator-associated pneumonia and post-operative intra-abdominal infections.

A pathogen or source can be found around that time point and antibiotic regimen can be safely stopped.
Long-term therapy for S. aureus and uncomplicated candidemia .
As leucocyte scintigraphy, and PET scans.
The case of ongoing instability or clinical worsening is complex and may be due to multiple different causes.
Infections related to the high intensity of care, such as VAP, CLABSI, or a CAUTI, are always important to investigate.
The new regimen should take in account colonization and the most frequent pathogens and resistance patterns according to the source and patient category.
Noninfectious causes of fever and venous thromboembolism .
Community-acquired and healthcare-associated BSIs are common situations to manage and are associated with impaired outcomes, especially in case of sepsis/septic shock, immune deficiency, and delayed adequate antimicrobial therapy and/or source control.
Antimicrobial de-escalation should be considered once culture results become available and the source of BSI is identified and controlled.

The end of inspiration was defined at the point of negative airflow as recorded by the ventilator.
Comparison of Tmin and ventilator beginning of inspiration .
Event-triggered averaging for global tidal variations .
Tmin values were markedly different between the two methods, both for the global EIT signal and the 4 ROI waveforms.
The low-pass filtering Tmin occurred earlier than the ventilator insufflation in the global EIT signal and the 4 ROIs.
We compared event-triggered waveform averaging, applied to EIT waveforms for cardiac related impedance changes, with the standard method based on the application of a lowpass filter.
Inspiratory time by event-triggered averaging and earlier than ventilator beginning of inspiration .
We propose an event-triggered averaging method for EIT waveforms that removes cardiac artifacts while preserving the ventilation signal.
Event-trigger averaged processing led to a greater tidal amplitude variation than the filtering technique.
We showed that the event-triggered average method identifies Tmin much closer to the ventilator as compared to the standard low-pass filtering.

Distancing in time from the triggering event, due to breath-to-breath differences .
Using the event-triggered average for respiratory waveform analysis .
We used flow value rather than the peak value as we did.
We used a common filter setting equal to 40/min , which normally separates well respiratory from cardiac signal being half-way between a high limit respiratory rate and a low limit heart rate.
Event-triggered averaging of the EIT signal in a range that should fit most of the patients.
A different approach based on an event-triggered averaged waveform is feasible and appears more similar to the ventilator.

A conservative approach may be appropriate in poor patients, particularly those aged over 80, with an awareness of the increased risk of complications.
Subdural haematoma in older patients with head injury .
A CSDH is a condition almost exclusively confined to the elderly, with a median age of 77 in the UK .
Control the inflammatory response in CSDH, and, therefore, reducing CSDH recurrence following surgery or even as a first-line treatment .
 ASDH following a minor fall is often exacerbated by the fact that nearly two-third of these patients are on anti-thrombotic medications .
A recent review of 165 ASDHs in a German hospital reported 41.2% of them occurring in patients aged 80 or over .
Anti-thrombotic medications at presentation is also clearly a risk factor for poor outcome in all patients .
Surgical decision-making in elderly patients with poor neurology and multi-morbidity .
Large-scale studies assessing interventions for severe traumatic brain injury in general, including decompressive craniectomy , ICP monitoring , and cooling , have either excluded older patients or had minimal numbers of them.
A lack of evidence has led to varying practices and understanding about interventions for TBI .
A patient has the intracranial pressure effects and focal neurological deficits associated with the ICH in addition to the systemic co-morbidities of cardiac, peripheral vascular disease, and often anti-thrombotic medication use.
STICH I and II trials did not demonstrate any overall benefit from early surgery compared with initial conservative management.
A meta-analysis on MIS for hypertensive ICH .
More studies and in a wider population of older patients are needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.
MIS improved outcome compared to both craniotomy and conservative treatment.
With standard care for large ICH, a modest survival benefit is identified.
The comprehensive geriatric assessment is an established tool used to assess the needs of older people and implement investigations and treatments to improve long-term outcomes.
Cross-over with disability and co-morbidity .
A frailty score based on the assessment of data from 27,098 cranial neurosurgical cases has been reported, where higher scores had good sensitivity and specificity for predicting increased 30-day mortality .
Higher mFI scores in brain tumours are associated with increased mortality, severe neurological complications and prolonged length of stay.
Standardised assessments of frailty are needed, with validation in large cohorts of neurosurgical patients across a range of pathologies.
Elderly patients with multiple co-morbidities should be considered for neurosurgical interventions.
A therapeutic nihilism can be deterministic and thwart development of improved clinical practice.

We identified an association of infection as well as specific infection subtypes with subsequent VTE after ICH.
Developed VTE prior to infection 26] .
Longer LOS, sicker patients, lower GCS, and surgical interventions are all risk factors for infections.
DVT prophylaxis in ICH patients with hematoma expansion takes longer than expected.
In severe cases of ICH injury, patients are at increased risk for infection such as pneumonia.
Infection, and notably sepsis, induces a marked pro-inflammatory cascade leading to downstream endothelial dysfunction and thrombosis risk.
Prothrombotic systemic environment and time to first administration of DVT Prophylaxis, median days mechanisms might explain the higher incidence of VTE in patients admitted with sepsis.
A study on the link between infection and VTE.
Using date of clinical suspicion to predict downstream VTE occurrence is a limitation, using the latter would have strengthened the model.
Early weaning protocols, early Foley removal, minimizing use of CVCs, and early physical therapy including ambulation of patients even when ventilated would be informative for VTE prevention.
ICH patients should be considered in ICH patients in the setting of infection.

We defined seven variables and their relevance factor, where 10 is associated to the highest importance and 0 the least importance .
We defined qualitative and quantitative domains for each of the variables.
We normalized the index and used the result of the index to group the equipment.
A mathematical model of our index incorporates all the variables, along with their weighting factor, as described below.
 IPMEM is the Index to Prioritize Medical Equipment Maintenance.
We obtain the value of N as follows: Substituting the corresponding values in the expression 2, we obtain thevalue of N.

The Tocqueville principle of enlightened self-interest .
Man is brought home to himself by an irresistible force. As attempts to stop the omnipotent force would be in vain, efforts should be not on stopping it, but directing it and applying it such a way to allow man to be more virtuous.
 Enlightened self-interest is accessible because it negates the debate over the underlying or base motivation and focuses on aligning self- interest with the interest of others to result in behaviors that benefit all.
 ESIA for medical students presents medical students with attainable altruistic goals that can co-exist with the colossal task of becoming a physician.
Incorporating the ESIA framework into medical school curriculum includes education on the drives underlying altruism, the fostering of altruism through practice, and appreciation of the alignment of self-interests and service to others.

Vaccination is one of the most effective public health interventions successfully controlling many serious infectious diseases .
Temporal associations with vaccines from purely a temporal association are often incorrect as unrelated events will occur by chance.
Confidence in vaccination programme without which coverage drops and disease control is lost.
A selection of vaccine safety studies involving neurological disease with differing conclusions; some of the included studies have shown a small elevated risk, others none.
A formal epidemiological study is usually needed to establish whether the signal seen is associated with the vaccine and to quantify the risk.
An assessment of the likelihood of residual confounding/ bias and its potential extent is an important consideration when weighing up the strength of a study and drawing a conclusion.
In a cohort study, the risk of developing the condition is compared in the vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals in the study population.
Be adjusted for in the analysis as they can independently determine the likelihood of the adverse event under study.
An entire population is studied and relative and absolute incidence estimates can be reported.
Vaccine datasets are used and the transfer and sharing of data is not comprehensive.
Cohort studies are feasible for vaccine safety studies when data from a whole country or region can be used.
The self-controlled case-series method was designed for rapid unbiased assessment in vaccine safety studies using available disease surveillance data.
The SCCS method is nearly as good as cohort study when uptake is high and risk intervals are short, and it is superior to that of a casecontrol study .
Self-controlled case-series method for vaccine safety .
Vaccination can be estimated and cases attributable to vaccination estimated from the magnitude of the RI.
A case-control study requires smaller numbers than a cohort study but the same confounding and bias can occur.
A case-control study does not provide absolute risk estimates, rather it measures the odds of vaccination in cases compared to controls.
Vaccination risk is estimated from the magnitude of the odds ratio.
A case-control design has been used where controls can be selected from the same population as cases and can be readily matched on the relevant variables.
The case-coverage design has recently been used in vaccine safety studies .
This design has been used by Public Health England to assess the risk between AS03 adjuvanted H1N1 pandemic vaccine Pandemrix™ and narcolepsy.
The SCCS method and the case-coverage design were found not to be clear in assessing the risk of narcolepsy in children.
The SCCS method has now become the gold standard design in vaccine safety studies, but the methods should be adapted and potential biases considered in the context of the population under study, the dataset being utilised and the hypothesis being tested.

Biodiversity-infectious disease interactions have roots as far back as Charles Elton 4 and have influenced the fields of integrated pest management of crops 5
The dilution effect hypothesis proposes that biodiversity can reduce the abundance of a particular parasite species per host and thus reduce the risk of infectious disease caused by that parasite.
Biodiversity-infectious disease associations, or an amplification effect 6, -defined by Keesing et al. 27 as the opposite of the dilution effect.

Biodiversity-Disease Relationships .
Biodiversity management as a tool for disease control.
Biodiversity is unlikely to increase or decrease directly transmitted, specialist parasites without free-living stages, intermediate hosts or vectors .
Biodiversity can influence the sensitivity of parasites to biodiversity .
Biodiversity regulates the density of susceptible wildlife hosts that might then pass directly transmitted parasites amongst themselves .
 amplification effect, and unimodal relationships support both dilution and amplification under different circumstances.
Understanding the relationships between biodiversity and disease risk, link biodiversity change to change in both disease burden and metrics of disease risk.
A list of pathogens that are likely to respond to biodiversity.
What is the shape of the biodiversity-disease relationship?
Unimodal biodiversity-disease relationships are often left-skewed or asymptotic, where the diversity of a community falls on these curves is also important, because if most communities fall in the right or left portions of unimodal diversity-Disease curves, respectively
We must focus research on assessing the shape of diversity-disease risk relationships and identifying where systems generally fall along the x axis of diversity.
Biodiversity and disease risk in changing landscapes .
Biodiversity has a much stronger impact on disease burden than does management of biodiversity.
Biodiversity can increase or decrease disease risk, and because many experimental studies manipulate species composition in conjunction with biodiversity, the effects of these factors are difficult to disentangle 51
Biodiversity and diseases where little is known about their ecology are hard to manage. In contrast, interventions might be targeted to specific species or habitats that are known to amplify or dilute disease.
A dichotomy of the probabilities of each option.
The right-skewed distribution suggests that amplification might occur more frequently but less intensely than dilution, because the relationship is moderately positive over a greater portion of the biodiversity gradient than it is strongly negative.
Biodiversity affects disease risk, particularly when changes in diversity are substitutive-that is, adding new species to a community reduces the abundance of existing species .
Overall Diversity: communities in which many zoonotic diseases can be amplified 10 .
Managing diversity will de facto result in management of composition 20 .
What are the mechanisms underlying biodiversity-disease relationships?
Competent hosts for focal parasites can be predicted by a number of traits, including phylogenetic relatedness to focal hosts 36,63-65 .
The extent to which species composition relate to biodiversity depends on community assembly-how species are added to a community-which can be affected by the previously mentioned species traits 55, 74, 75 .
Improving on last year's performance, but not enough to avoid a rise in unemployment.
Host diversity increases the combined burden of all pathogens while decreasing the disease burden of individual pathogens .
Dilution should predominate when community disassembly is substitutive and competent hosts are abundant or are resilient to biodiversity loss.
The most abundant and widespread amphibian hosts are also the most competent hosts for parasitic trematode species .
Community assembly and disassembly processes support dilution effects documented for Lyme disease 20, 45, 55, 74 .
Extrapolations beyond collected data on biodiversity-disease relationship.
The dependence of dilution and amplification on spatial scale has been a common thread throughout the biodiversity-disease debate 11, 12, 35 .

Disease decreased significantly when transitioning from the across-country global comparison to the within-country, across-time comparison .
We cannot attribute differences in effect size and magnitude to differences in scale .
Biodiversity does vary with spatial scale and, if so, that we identify the mechanisms that drive this relationship.
Diversity at large scales predicts disease patterns, and management of diversity can sometimes be feasible as a means of managing disease.
We used Hedges' g from Civitello et al. 17 to account for the lack of independence among multiple effect sizes within studies and for the same diseases.
Diversity-disease associations are more likely for among-country comparisons than for comparisons within a country, over time.
Smaller-scale studies compiled in Civitello et al. 17 were more likely to find negative diversitydisease associations.

Under which biodiversity-disease relationships are ecologically influential 48 .
Deterministic community assembly mechanisms are not well established and can change stochastically through time .
The shape of biodiversity-disease relationships is unclear, and where they sit relative to the diversity axis is unclear.
Metrics of disease and diversity can vary widely across biodiversity-disease studies, but whether the choice of metric influences the study outcome is poorly understood.
Biodiversity-disease relationships remain equivocal, but the common mechanisms by which non-hosts affect infectious disease remain uncertain.
Context dependencies for biodiversity-disease relationships .
An emergent property of biodiversity in general, or spurious correlations driven by other factors?
Context dependencies, context dependencies,context dependencies, Context dependencies.
An important potential context dependency for biodiversitydisease relationships is spatial scale.
We believe that biodiversity should have a greater effect on multi-host, wildlife, vector-borne and zoonotic diseases than on directly transmitted, host-specialist diseases.
Biodiversity-disease relationships are scale-dependent, and from a conservation perspective, a disease causing widespread extirpations or extinctions is different from one that is not consistently causing wildlife declines.

Cereal venous compartment changes in the positivepressure ventilation setting may be another such factor.
C cerebral pressure passivity during experimental induction of hypotension, presumably due to a decrease in the transcerebral blood pressure gradient .
 venous hemodynamics might play an underrecognized role in disrupting cerebral pressure autoregulation.
An increased pCO 2 related to pressure passivity is not surprising, given that changes in circulating CO 2 are known to influence cerebrovascular responses.
Positive-pressure ventilation is associated with fluctuating increases in intrathoracic pressure, and decreased venous return.
We found that the fluctuating venous volumes in our study were not an independent predictor of brain injury, but did predict cerebral pressure passivity.
Cereal pressure-flow passivity in infants receiving positive-pressure ventilation is associated with brain injury, regardless of underlying critical illness and GA.
Bedside monitoring is a promising method for assessing the effect of a child's age on their health.
Cereal HbT changes occurring at the positive-pressure ventilatory frequency were occurring on the venous side of the cerebral circulation alone.
HbT was noted during constant ventilator settings, suggesting that other as yet unknown factors may be playing a role in these complex hemodynamics.
Hemodynamic and neuroimaging findings differed across the three diagnostic groups.
Changes in cerebral venous volume in critically ill newborn infants, particularly those at risk for hypotension, may be an underappreciated factor in the development of cerebral pressure passivity in this vulnerable population.

A survey of social workers on whether they agree with the statement: "I am glad I chose social work as my profession."
This item asked respondents about their level of agreement with the statement: "I am valued as a professional in society" with response choices ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree.
T-tests were used to compare the results of the two age cohorts for compassion satisfaction, workplace stress, the eight workplace environment issues, and the items regarding being "glad one chose social work" and feeling valued as a professional in society.
Compassion satisfaction and workplace stress were stratified according to gender , race , sexual orientation , presence of mental health problems , and presence of serious physical health problems .
The mean age of the participants was 45.5 , with a range of 21 to 86.3 .
Almost 90% of the sample identified as female, 11% as male, with only 0.3% identifying their gender as non-binary.
Nearly a third of the sample reported having serious physical health problems, and nearly 29% indicated that they were experiencing mental health problems.
Over 80% of the sample reported that their highest degree was an MSW, over 39% of respondents worked only in direct practice, with the remainder performing both functions.
The older social workers were far more likely to identify as male .
Agnostic social workers are less likely to report being single, divorced/separated and widowed .
Older social workers are more likely to work exclusively in private practice .
The older workers were more likely to report having worked in mental health settings, with families and couples, with aging/older adults, in disaster response, and in employee assistance programs.
Compassion Satisfaction for Social Workers Working in Direct Practice with Clients .
Compassion satisfaction for those working exclusively in private practice .
Working exclusively in private practice is not associated with compassion satisfaction .
The older cohort had higher stress scores for seven out of the eight workplace environment factors.
Social workers in the older group either strongly agreed or agreed with the statement, "I am glad I chose social work as my profession" than those in the younger group.
Compassion satisfaction and workplace stress by age group when stratified by demographic and wellness factors.
Older social workers report higher levels of compassion satisfaction than younger social workers.
Age difference in workplace stress between heterosexual and sexual minorities.
Being age 60 and older is significantly associated with workplace stress.
Being born in the United States is correlated with less compassion satisfaction, being single and divorced/separated is associated with greater workplace stress.
Work, and feeling valued in society as a professional.
Compassion satisfaction in social work is positively associated with being glad one chose social work and feeling valued as a professional.
Older employed social workers report greater compassion satisfaction, lower levels of workplace stress, and greater likelihood of being glad they chose social work as a profession.
The older social workers had statistically significant higher levels of compassion satisfaction in every group.
The aging process is seen as multidirectional, involving both losses and gains .
Social workers who experience survivorship bias are more likely to leave the profession before age 60.
Evolving Ethnic Minorities in Social Work Education .
Older people are more likely to believe in God than younger people.
Male social workers are more likely to be widowed or divorced/separated than female social workers.
A survey of 60- and 70-year-old men and women on gender identity.
Social workers 60 years and older are more likely to be male and White, while younger social workers are overwhelmingly female and White.
Social workers with substance use problems are more likely than the general population to admit their problem.
Elderly and younger social workers from all age groups achieve mean scores in the high range of compassion satisfaction.
Compassion satisfaction, workplace stress, feeling glad one chose social work as a career, and feeling valued as a professional in society.
A study of compassion satisfaction in older social workers .
A social worker's compassion satisfaction is positively correlated with the ability to empathize, indicating that older social workers may be a very valuable resource in working with clients in general.
Older workers tend to have greater work satisfaction than younger workers .
A cross-sectional study of licensed social workers in the United States .
Older social workers are more likely to respond truthfully to stigmatizing personal questions such as those focusing on mental health and substance misuse.
Social workers who remain in the profession after age 60 have higher levels of compassion satisfaction and more positive attitudes towards both having chosen social work as a profession and their current work environments than their younger counterparts.
More research is needed to explore the differences in characteristics between the older social workers who remain in the workforce compared to those who are no longer employed.

We and others in the HIV Vaccine Trials Network have been developing statistical approaches and frameworks for this process.
A statistical framework for selecting up to 3 regimens to advance for concurrent testing in a later, multiregimen HIV vaccine efficacy trial.
A rank/filtering/selection algorithm based on ranking and hypothesis testing was developed to select regimens satisfying these two criteria.
A large number of candidate immune response endpoints, evaluated over multiple laboratories, can create an unnecessary measurement burden and also have a negative impact on the down-selection process.
We investigate and propose algorithms for selecting immune response endpoints to enter into down-selection, taking into account information about the importance of individual endpoints as correlates of a vaccine.
A large number of candidate endpoints are available for comparison between intervention groups.
We compare the performance of the proposed feature selection algorithms combined with RFS to that of naive RFS without feature selection under various settings.
We consider a phase I randomized immunogenicity trial with m vaccine arms.
Response endpoint from participant k from regimen j and let ij indicate the mean of X ijk .
The down-selection process is to select up to Q regimens that are superior among the set of candidate regimens and that have unique immune profiles.
We use the negative value of the original immune response measurement as the endpoint of interest in the framework we will describe next.
A regimen A is considered superior, inferior, or equivalent to another regimen B with respect to a particular endpoint i if the mean of the endpoint in A is larger , smaller , or the same compared to that in B.
A vaccine regimen A is non-redundant to regimen B if A is not superior, not inferior, and not equivalent.
A ranking, filtering, and selection algorithm to down-select regimens.

The presence of highly correlated immune response endpoints can decrease performance of the down-selection process.
A review of surrogate endpoints for down-selection trials .
Pre-selecting a subset of immune response endpoints most useful for down-selection to feed into the RFS algorithm.
We propose a penalization-based feature selection method based on optimizing the reward of adding more endpoints for use in regimen down-selection.
G and c are the gain and the cost functions corresponding to adding more immune response endpoints.
We propose a simple and efficient way of defining g and c as additive functions of S and S as where controls the cost due to correlation among the chosen immune response endpoints in set S.
We use constraint i < i ′ to choose each correlation coefficient only one time .
S to S is ∉ S to S.
We propose a heuristic sequential algorithm, based on these two rules, that significantly reduces search complexity.
The property of which is stated in Theorem 1 below.
S gives a local maximum of the reward function in .
The heuristic algorithm stops with the chosen set S, meaning that for any single-added endpoint k ∉ S we have r k < 0 .
A generalization of S-R-K and R-S-R.
A desired decomposition is guaranteed at least when S ⋆ contains only two endpointS.
We show that for S ′ ≠ 0 and we aim to add more than one endpoint, we need to have Since | ik ′ .
Adding a single endpoint like k to set S can improve the overall reward, which is in contradiction with the stopping criterion of our proposed heuristic algorithm.
B = 1 can be a legitimate choice, and simulation results for different settings suggest that b = 1 is a legitimate option.
We use clustering methods to select an appropriate subset of immune response endpoints based on the observed values in different regimens.
R i ′ is the reward for moving endpoint i from S c to S, and S * is the final set of selected immune response endpoints that will be used in regimen down-selection.
Clustering of multivariate immune response endpoints using BIC-based clustering.
BIC-based selection method tends to choose fewer immune response endpoints when immune responseEndpoints are highly correlated, since there are fewer clusters from which to choose one endpoint.
We need an importance weight w i reflecting the importance of each immune response endpoint i to a vaccine's protective effect.
Endpoints in regimen ranking, using a special risk modeling setting.
A special model for disease risk conditional on potential multivariate immune responses if receiving a vaccine regimen.
Modeling disease risk conditional on potential vaccine-induced immune responses .
A list of models for vaccine-induced immune responses and disease risk.
X j is the potential outcome of a set of immune response endpoints of dimension p for a participant if receiving vaccine regimen j.
Scale the measure by the corresponding standard deviation first to achieve the common variance.
We show that the cumulative distribution function of a standard normal distribution is a normal distribution.
The disease prevalence among the placebo group P can then be derived by integrating P with respect to distribution of j .
A monotone increasing function of the weighted mean of the immune response endpoint induced by the vaccine with weight equal to − 3 .
In theory, the immune response endpoints measured from a phase I immunogenicity study for down-selection have all been measured together in a previous efficacy trial to allow the risk modeling in , which is based on multivariate immune responseEndpoints to estimate the optimal weight.
Weighting of immune response endpoint based on its interaction with the treatment in disease risk model .
A partial set of multivariate immune responses is available from existing efficacy trial data, we can also estimate importance weights for each endpoint in the partial set.
In practice, any immune response measured in the laboratory is accompanied by a certain degree of inherent measurement error.
Response endpoints based on treatment status in the disease risk model conditional on the vaccine-induced immune response.
We apply the RFS algorithm for regimen downselection, using the weighted average as the criterion for ranking regimens based on pre-specified weights of immune response endpoints.
Evaluating the superiority and non-redundancy criteria for selecting the top Q regimens .
The probability that a regimen that should be selected is actually selected, i.e. the 'true positive rate' .
We use the NbClust R package for clustering the observed immune response endpoints.
We assume that the p = 30 observed immune response endpoints can be grouped into two clusters of 15 endpoints each.
We assume both true points have mean and variance 1 and all immune response endpoints measured are empirically measured versions of the underlying true endpoints.
Non-redundant to each other and superior to the other regimens, and thus the desired regimens to be selected.
We consider two clusters, each containing 15 immune response endpoint measurements. The naive method includes all immune response endpoints in down-selection.
The proposed penalization-based method select around 6.7% of the total immune response endpoints to enter regimen down-selection.
Our proposed feature-selection methods outperform the naive method .
A modified version of setting I: within each cluster, only the first five immune response endpoints have non-zero means and are empirically measured versions of the true underlying immune response endpoint.
Feature-selection-based and BIC-based selection methods select 6.7% of the total immune response endpoints to enter the RFS algorithm.
Differentiating regimens with more endpoints is more conservative, but the impact on FPR and PPV is minimal.
We consider a modified version of setting II such that only the first 10 immune response endpoints in each cluster have non-zero means and are empirically measured versions of the true underlying immune response endpoint.
The first five endpoints in each cluster have higher importance weights and thus better chances of being chosen during feature selection.
Comparing penalization-based , BIC-based, and naive selection methods with respect to the average number of selected regimens, TPR, FPR, and PPV.
Clustering of immune response endpoint measurements using BIC-based method .
A penalization-based feature-selection method for immune response endpoint selection .
Zero mean that are not associated with differential vaccine efficacy across regimens.
We investigated performance based on mixed binary and continuous endpoints in another setting VI, which is derived from setting II by discretizing 40% of the continuous end points into binary endpoints.

Immune Response Endpoints for HVTN Vaccine Recipients .
DNA prime plus NYVAC + AIDSVAX B/E boosts .
A heatmap of correlations between the eight immune response endpoints measured using the binding antibody multiplex assay with different HIV antigens.
We first entered all eight immune response endpoints into the RFS down-selection process as in Huang et al.
We selected ICS, B1, and NAb because they all have the same importance wights.
The BIC-based feature selection algorithm assigned B2 and B3 in the same clusters and assigned the remaining six endpoints into six individual clusters.
An analysis of immune response endpoints for the first time.
We also investigated our feature selection algorithms using a second set of weights that correspond to the magnitude of the log-transformed univariate odds ratio for the association of each individual immune response endpoint with infection risk.
B2 has the lowest correlation with other endpoints and was chosen first. B6 was chosen because of its low correlation.
Setting 096T3: setting the only regimen selected.
Identifying a parsimonious set of immune response endpoints most relevant for a vaccine's protective effect is essential in this down-selection practice, because the identification of such a set can lead to better down- selection performance and also significant resource savings in terms of lab assay measurements.
The number of endpoints increases, the number of Endpoints increases.
We developed new algorithms for dimension reduction when multiple candidate endpoints are available to rank and select regimens.
Immune response endpoints from HIV phase-I immunogenicity studies can involve multiple immune classes. The penalization-based or clusteringbased approach for feature selection can then be applied to the list of candidates, ignoring the immune class information.
A caveat of the proposed feature selection algorithms is the need to input a relative importance weight of an individual immune response endpoint with respect to its relevance to the vaccine's protective effect.
Smaller importance weights are excluded in the penalized-based feature selection process, due to their smaller importance weights.
The importance weights as new data become available, in order to reduce the uncertainty in weight estimation.

Empirical empathy from the perspective of physician assistants .
Empirical empathy is learned largely through the hidden curriculum .
We focus on PA students for the purpose of this study, and underlined the belief that the understanding of clinical empathy stands to benefit from a multidisciplinary approach.
Empathy is a pillar of patient-centred consulting and its humanist importance is not in doubt .

Empirical empathy with an affective component .
The study was funded by a grant from the National Institutes of Health, and the study was facilitated through email and face to face discussions.
Fourteen student PAs were female and five were male, with the most commonly held position being that of a healthcare assistant.
In this paper, the clinical tutors approached, none expressed any disagreement with the results and two provided more indepth verbal feedback which is tackled in the "Discussion" section.
Organisation of open codes under 6 sub-themes .
The global themes of empathy pathways, empathy modifiers, and empathic dissonance relate to the discomfort students feel when making statements of empathy that they themselves know are insincere.
Empirical statements like 'I am sorry to hear that' are more effective when supported by non-verbal communication:
Towards the end of the talk, he said that tone of voice is also equally as important as what you say.
Attentive listening to explore a patient's problems was seen as a more effective empathic strategy than just making a quick statement and moving on:
Non-verbal attributes of empathy identified by students included eye contact, open body language and mirroring:
I don't smile all the time, I try to keep my tone where the patient's is…
Practical actions like passing tissues, or getting down to a bed-bound patient's height, were appreciated as empathic.
Empirical training for people with mental health problems.
Cognitive and Affective Empathy: A Survey of Students' Experiences.
Empirical empathy from the head: switching between heart and head approach:
Empathising with people with mental health problems is not just cognitive, it's from the heart.
Heart empathy was seen as more human and genuine, but brought an emotional burden and risked the problems of compassion fatigue and a sense of bringing the patient's problems home with you:
Empathy is not enough, and you can't throw all your emotion into everything.
Cognitive empathy was observed to be practised through the use of empathic statements, not always convincingly.
A cognitive approach is needed in primary care, due to time constraints.
Clinicians are wearing masks of caring, and seen to be building walls between themselves and patients to shield them from emotional engagement:
A lot of doctors put on an exterior, an emotional exterior, so it stops them from being too involved emotionally.
Breaking from ward rounds to spend time with patients signalled strong empathic intentions:
A patient refused to drink his lactulose and a nurse stayed with him for ages to make him comfortable.
Cannula procedures such as putting a cannula in… because it becomes such, like, a natural thing for clinicians to do they often forget to say, 'this might hurt a little… sorry' kind of thing.'
Junior doctors are often seen as pressed for time and the picture emerged of juniors applying empathic remediation.
Higher-level doctors are more likely to show empathy than junior doctors.
Empirical studies show that the pressure of time can make people less empathic.
Empirical empathy and the time constraints.
Empirical empathy for patients who have predicaments that they can personally relate to:
Towards a heart felt response to cancer patients.
An overdose is not something that I might necessarily go through, so I wouldn't feel as emotional.
Students described finding it easier to feel empathy for patients facing serious diagnoses, like cancer, and conversely finding it difficult to empathise with patients who were worrying about trivial issues, like headaches.
A patient was in tears over a cat, the vet laughed, the patient walked out.
Unhelpful patient agendas are seen as barriers to empathic alignment, particularly in the arenas of drug and alcohol misuse.
A nurse has described how she was scared for her life when a patient tried to punch a doctor.
Opinions around teaching centred on empathic statements were problematic, largely because students felt pushed to make these statements when they were not feeling for the patient.
"I've been pulled up a few times by my GP because sometimes I don't say 'oh, I feel sorry for you'… because I feel like it's too robotic."
OSCE empathy is an exercise in 'box ticking' rather than true connection.
Students felt forced into communicating in a less than genuine way and worried such deception would be detected by the patient:
We asked people if they really meant what they were saying, and they told us they did.
Students reported multiple role-model empathy scenarios, especially in the arena of breaking bad news.
In this paper, narratives were often qualified by students reflecting on deficient practice and determining not to follow the footsteps of negative role models.
A patient on a trolley was told he had lesions on his spine and he thought it was because he had been carrying his bags on the wrong shoulder.
We propose a model which furthers our understanding of how clinical empathy is practiced and the factors which influence this.
Cognitive empathy is seen as a solution to the pressures of time and as a way of avoiding emotional burden.
We believe there are more similarities than differences, but differences there undeniably are.
Female clinicians are more empathic than male clinicians .
Empirical empathy is not just a cognitive or affective endeavour; it is a multi-disciplinary construct.
Empirical empathy is seen as a solution to the emotional burden that affective empathy can bring.
Empathy without feeling is no kind of empathy .
Cognitive empathy is a method used by actors to feel emotionally as their character would and use the emotions to drive the performance .
Students see cognitive empathy as a solution to the pressures of time.
Students in this study aspire to affective empathy, a more widely encompassing process, practised not just with words but with compassionate actions.
Empirical empathy does not have to be purely cognitive, for that is limiting the concept.
We are socialising students into a kind of empathic practice that is ultimately impoverished, less natural than the one they came to medical school with.
Negative role-modelling can cause students to react in a negative way.
Empirical Statements are not a substitute for Emotional Engagement .
Empirical students are being pushed to make 'tick-box' statements when no true empathy is felt.
We use the term empathic dissonance to capture the problem of tick-box empathy and the disconnect that occurs when students feel pressure to make statements with no true feeling behind them.
Empirical training is encouraging students and clinicians to fake their empathy .
Fake empathy is a symptom of over-reliance on the empathic statement at the cost of more natural empathic communication.
We question whether empathy should be assessed in OSCEs in any form, but if it is, then would it better to reserve it for a limited number of specific stations, like breaking bad news?

Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity .
Obesity is an important respiratory risk factor as it causes reduced functional residual capacity, compliance and oxygenation before and after both surgery and anesthesia .
Intraperitoneal administration of carbon dioxide gas for laparoscopic surgeries frequently increases intraabdominal pressure, pushing the diaphragm upwards and causing compression of the lungs.
Anesthesia management during operations on obese patients is to keep the airway and alveoli open during respiration .
RM on postoperative arterial oxygenation after LSG in obese patients.
This study included patients aged 18-65 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists III, Body Mass Index 40-55 undergoing LSG surgery after informing them about the effects of RM performed after desufflation.
Emergency operation planned, with situations representing contraindications to performing the RM, and using medications that affect respiratory functions like salbutamol, budesonide, and formoterol were excluded from the study.
A threechannel electrocardiogram, peripheral oxygen saturation, noninvasive blood pressure, electroencephalographic data.

Lung-protective ventilation strategy, PEEP administration, and alveolar recruitment maneuvers prevent atelectasis and positively affect intraoperative gas exchange which prevents the development of hypoxemia.
PEEP with the RM ensures better oxygenation and compliance compared with patients with only PEEP applied .
PEEP and RM together improve ventilation and oxygenation of weakly ventilated lung volumes.
Atelectasis, and less postoperative respiratory complications with PEEP and 40 cmH 2 O recruitment procedure for 7-8 s.
We used 100% oxygen only during the RM and as part of this maneuver for only 40 s.
No difference between the groups in the T4 measurements performed at the 15th min after desufluation.
Laparoscopic surgery with increased intraabdominal pressure and CO 2 insufflation decreases arterial pH and increases in PaCO 2 values due to CO 2 retention.
Two groups for pH values; however, we determined a decrease pH values at T2, T3, and T4 in both groups compared with the T1 pH value.
We identified that this was significant in the recruitment group.
The RM performed after desufflation in laparoscopic surgery is effective to completely regain lung compliance.
Raw and PIP values in both groups increased with insufflation, and we identified they regressed to values before pneumoperitoneum with desufflation.
Adding the RM to PEEP administration for morbidly obese patients undergoing LSG surgery is a more effective method to improve central hemodynamics.
A review of respiratory mechanics and arterial blood gas values that can be used safely.
A simple and lowcost test which assesses lung health .
A model-based method of measuring lung mechanics during spirometry, or eventually with a standalone device.
Large muscular expiratory effort can increase airway resistance as airways are constricted, and even cause gas trapping if small airways collapse.
Lung mechanics of tidal breathing at average breathing effort are better marker of lung condition than peak expiratory effort.
The QV loop presented in Fig. 2 is for this airflow attributed to the shutter.
Non-linear and non-zero regions in the QV loop represent time-varying mechanics not present in the average tidal breathing waveform.
No clear trend can be identified, with the average decay rate at each resistance level remaining unchanged.
A venturi inserted between the mouthpiece and flow sensor added noise to the flow measurements due to turbulent airflow.
Lung elastance at shutter opening and the effect of added resistance .
R rs is not proportional to added resistance, as had been expected.
The effect of external resistance on ROCC is shown in Fig. 7 .
The shutter duration used in this study was twice as long as the minimum required.
An assumption used in data analysis was the airflow in response to shuttering would be superimposed on average tidal breathing.
Large variation in decay rate and post-shutter waveforms indicate muscular reaction to shuttering.
A study on muscular reaction to shuttering and flow rate limitations.
Breath-to-breath variation may reduce, because each breath could be driven subconsciously.
The expected range of static elastance for healthy lungs is 2-10 cmH 2 Os/L .
Tidally breathing subjects, increased elastance indicates muscular breathing effort.
Smaller than expected airway resistance with low skin friction effects .
Time for air to flow from higher friction areas, resulting in a poor airway resistance estimate.
Rocc is an established method to measure airway resistance during tidal breathing, but the increase in Rocc increased as external resistance was added.
A linear end-expiratory relationship between flow and volume during tidal breathing .
Increasing breathing effort can obscure passive elastance in some cases.
Lung viscoelasticity tends to increase the pressure during shutter closure, leading to changes in lung mechanics.
A simple, portable, hand-held device could be used to measure these lung mechanics.
A novel method to non-invasively measure lung mechanics of tidally breathing subjects.
Lung function testing with a small standalone device, or standard lung function testing equipment.
The dynamic elastance, single-compartment lung model.
Driving pressure needed to oppose passive respiratory elastic forces and maintain airflow through respiratory airways.
Direct measurement of respiratory driving pressure, E dy V , is not possible without highly invasive measures, such as an oesophageal balloon catheter.
Drivers can be created by vastly different driving pressures.
A simple lung model describing the balance of elastic and resistive force in the lung:
The decay rate of airflow in response to a change in driving pressure depends on a combination of lung mechanics terms, E d and R rs .
A shutter built into a plethysmograph was used to induce exponentially decaying flow.
The lung's response to shuttering can be simulated with an electrical circuit, with the shutter modelled as a voltage-controlled switch, as shown in Fig 10 .
Tidal airflow can be separated from the measured flow using adaptive filtering.
An assumption of the single-compartment lung model is that passive lung mechanics do not change during the breath.

A modified vaccinia Ankara vector coding for non-structural viral proteins is being tested as a preventive approach in high-risk volunteers, but this strategy previously failed to restore the CD4 + T cell response in a study with chronic HCV patients .
The use of recombinant proteins for vaccine development is an attractive approach, since it allows a wide range of innovation in matter of antigen design.
An innate immune response characterized by the production of T helper 1 and proinflammatory cytokines makes them suitable for vaccines against viral infections .
An interesting and low-cost alternative for protein vaccine candidates could be the design of chimeric proteins in which several viral antigens are combined in a single protein.

EnvCNS3 with 92 additional residues provides NS3EnvCo with several epitopes that have being described as possible B cell epitopes.
A positive IFN-γ-secreting response against NS3 protein is related to a decrease in viral load .
The NS3EnvCo/E2.680/ODN39M formulation might constitute an effective immunogen against HCV with potential for reducing the likelihood of immune escape and viral persistence.
Ethically acceptable options are considered, preferably in conjunction with the patient, the family, and/or a surrogate decisionmaker, with the resulting ethical option agreed upon.
Ethical dilemmas that occur in austere environments, where decisions may be required without the opportunity to contemplate, consult, or discuss with patients or colleagues.

A review of emergency medical response in the aftermath of the earthquake in Nepal.
The National Disaster Life Support Foundation and the American Medical Association have partnered in the development of courses in disaster life support.
Nearly 80% of physicians surveyed desired to acquire further training in proper medical responses.
The AMA's Code of Medical Ethics addresses physician preparation for disasters at national, regional, or local levels.
In the wake of recent terror attacks, physicians must be adequately prepared to respond, both medically and ethically.
In this paper, we explore the ethical challenges of responding to mass casualty disasters caused by terrorists, natural calamities, and industrial accidents.
Terroristic attacks are more likely to occur on a large scale than on a smaller scale .
Natural disasters can involve any physician at any location .
The location of such crises may give rise to uncertainty in response efforts.
IEDs caused high-speed projectile secondary and tertiary injuries, which can be surgically challenging for responding medics and treating surgeons.
Saint Vincent Catholic Medical Center, the closest Level 1 trauma center to ground zero, activated detailed disaster plans within minutes, cancelling elective and outpatient services and clearing the emergency department in preparation for the expected wounded.

At the hospital during the crisis, patients in a special unit were able to be evacuated to the roof of the hospital through a 3′ × 3′ hole in the wall, by helicopter.
A triage system that reflects the austere environment under which the providers were required to make difficult patient care decisions.
Dr. Pou's actions during the Hurricane Katrina disaster led to a national discussion about the need for reasonable expansion of practice scope, and protection, for physicians treating patients in austere environments.
Health care providers in a state of public health emergency will not be civilly liable for causing the death of, or, injury to, any person or damage to any property.
Limiting surgeons' scope of practice in cases where they are not trained or knowledgeable is appropriate as an ethical responsibility.
A priori consideration is that of an equitable and appropriate triage protocol for patients who are considered to be "expectant" or have a do not resuscitate order in place.
A health care ethicist can provide the ethical perspective for disaster relief plans and protocols and should be a constant element for all institutions.
Towards Ethical Treatment of Terrorists .
The Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War states that the wounded, whether "members of armed forces who have laid down their arms" or "those placed out of action by sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause," should still be treatedhumanely, without
Using illegal war methods does not justify violations of those rules by the other side.
A physician's commitment to the ethical principle of social justice fit into this scenario of caring for a suspected terrorist.
A physician's ethical responsibility to treat terroristic suspects only according to their injury acuity, regardless of the emotional conflicts .
The AMA Code on Medical Ethics on physician disaster response and preparedness explicitly states that "Because of their commitment to care for the sick and injured, individual physicians have an obligation to provide urgent medical care during disasters".
Care in the future: care in the past .
Physicians cannot be available to care for victims if they become casualties themselves; therefore, physicians should be cognizant of the importance of their own safety and that of their healthcare team, as well as the safety of their patients.
Triage of injured patients in an emergency is considered a nuanced combination of medical/surgical priorities and the preservation of first responder and physician capabilities over the course of the treatment period.
In the extreme environment of combat, circumstances may arise that create tension on the sworn responsibilities of physician and officer.
A military physician working as an employee is bound by the same legal framework and international laws as a military physician.
Professions create their own standards and codes of ethics to maintain their effectiveness .
In the military context, the "minimal necessary" standard is applied, wherein the physician reveals only the minimum necessary information for him/her to assess and address the situation.
In military situations, the military physician is physician first and officer second.
Commanders require pertinent information from their medical officers that enable them to make appropriate decisions regarding operational planning, including the disposition of individual military personnel.
A medical officer must guard personal health information that is not critical to the mission, but might be prejudicial against the service member.
Placement of medical personnel close to combat units decreases the time from injury to treatment, but carries additional risk to medical personnel, installation, and supplies.
No care is provided to combatant forces until they "indicate surrender, drop all weapons, and are proven to no longer pose a threat".
In special forces units when the medic is also expected to perform additional non-medical combat functions.
Treating soldiers as components of a fighting force .
This paper presents a utilitarian analysis of the decision to use limited medical resources for comfort measures.
The triage of enemy combatants poses an additional ethical dilemma.
In this paper, we explore the role of the principle of autonomy in the treatment of wounded enemies.
The triage of patients may be delayed to protect medical assets including medical personnel.
In extreme situations, non-combatants are permitted to defend themselves and their patients if attacked by an enemy force if military considerations permit.

The First Critical Care Clinical Trialists Workshop 2019.
An online supplement to the 3CT Workshop on modifiable trial challenges .
Most critical care trials have failed to demonstrate clinical benefit because the studied interventions are truly ineffective.
Patients are unlikely to be modified by treatments targeting acute critical illness .
Underpowered clinical trials risk wasting resources and delivering false or uncertain conclusions.
Pilot trials can be used to provide estimates of the frequency and distribution of a planned primary end point and can aid in choosing which therapies warrant further investigation.
Target trial emulation, the application of design principles from randomized trials to the analysis of observational data, may provide more accurate estimates of baseline event rates and expected treatment effects .
Size targets mid-trial if lower than expected event rates are observed in the control group.
In this section, we discuss considerations for the trial design innovations that the 3CT Workshop participants considered most promising.
Prognostic enrichment designs seek to enroll patients with characteristics that suggest a high likelihood of experiencing the primary outcome.
A high expected event rate facilitates greater statistical power with fewer patients.

Core Outcomes Set: A Community-wide Agreement for Common Critical Care Outcomes .
The Protocolized Resuscitation in Sepsis Meta-Analysis study combined data from three large clinical trials assessing early, goaldirected therapy for septic shock .
Bayesian inference of trial results using Bayesian inference .
Bayesian effect estimate distribution using Bayesian trial results .
Bayesian re-analyses of the EOLIA and ANDROM-EDA-SHOCK trials demonstrated that the trial interventions were likely effective across a broad range of prior distributions.
Bayesian analysis can help ensure that trial results are more informative than coarse "positive" or "negative" delineation, particularly in trials appearing to have clinically significant treatment differences.
Bayesian effect estimates are heavily determined by the selected prior, and there is not currently a standard set of agreedupon priors for researchers to use.
Bayesian and frequentist analyses provide different but valuable information and perspectives and investigators should consider planning and reporting both frequentist and Bayesian analyses in future trials.
The 3CT Workshop participants noted the clear relevance and importance of mortality as a safety outcome measure, but there was a shared desire to incorporate patient-centered outcomes other than mortality.
Mortality is a logical trial outcome and many would argue survival is the most patient-centered outcome.
The Bayesian treatment effect estimate distribution is created by combining the likelihood function and priors.
Bayesian analysis of the EOLIA and ANDROMEDA-SHOCK trials for guidance on prior selection and execution of a Bayesian analysis .
No reliable method to estimate disease-specific modifiable mortality, and these calculations are likely to result in infeasibly large sample size targets.

Burn injuries are an under-appreciated trauma that can affect anyone, anytime and anywhere.
Electrical injuries cause colliquative necrosis, whereas acidic burn causes a coagulation necrosis .
Skin necrosis and deep tissue damage in deep thermal burns .
Partial-thickness burns are painful, weep, require dressing and wound care, and may scar, but do not require surgery. Deep burns are less painful owing to partial destruction of pain receptors, drier, require surgery and will scar.
A fourth-degree burn involves injury to deeper tissues, such as muscle or bone, is often blackened and frequently leads to loss of the burned part.
Injuries to the skin that constitute a major burn injury are not commonly well-defined; some guidance to classify severe burn injuries are: >10%TBSA in elderly patients, >20%TB SA in adults and >30% TBSA in children.
The uniqueness of a severe or major burn injury is anchored in the body responses to it.
The hypermetabolic response to burns does not cause healing but rather causes a generalized catabolic state and delayed healing.

Mycobacterial pathogens have acquired vastly diverse and highly successful survival strategies in the host, bolstered by the impermeable nature of their cell wall providing resistance to many toxins and drugs.
M. leprae is an obligate intracellular mycobacterium able to survive and multiply in phagocytic cells and to modulate the host immune system.
Inhibition of T H 1 responses to M. leprae leads to the severe, disseminated lepromatous form of the disease, in which a predominant T H 2 response is unable to control replication of the mycobacteria.
Cell-mediated protective immune responses to M. ulcerans infections and leprosy.

Genetic polymorphisms are likely to play an important role for the outcome of an exposure to M. ulcerans and M. leprae.
Vaccine design for mycobacterial diseases is hampered by the distinct resistance of the bacilli to many immune defense mechanisms and a lack of knowledge on immune effector functions required for protective immunity.

Antimicrobial De-escalation in Intensive Care Units .
Empirical regimens for antimicrobial resistance .
ADE is safe, but while improved outcomes are frequently reported, selection bias is prevalent: ADE is more frequently used in patients who are clinically improving .
Antimicrobial consumption linked to AMR, irrespective of the class of antibiotics.
A timeline of antimicrobial therapy including antimicrobial de-escalation, with the pivotal and companion antimicrobial components of the empirical regimen.
Adequate antimicrobial therapy active against the pathogen responsible for infection.
Collateral effects of antimicrobials, including downstream effects on the patient's microbiota.
ADE aims to reduce broad-spectrum antimicrobial exposure, and as a result decrease the emergence of AMR, without impairing patient outcomes.
ADE indirectly legitimises the use of broad-spectrum empirical therapy, as it suggests that-once the causative pathogen has been identified and the susceptibility is known-therapy can be scaled down.
ADE is associated with cost saving, since it allows reducing the use of expensive antimicrobials for short durations and using older and less expensive drugs for the continuation.
De-escalation ADE was welcomed as a remedy to mitigate the effects of empirical broad-spectrum agents with the assumption that short courses of those agents have little impact on the development of AMR.
 ADE can be used as an excuse for the indiscriminate prescription of broadspectrum antimicrobial regimens.
ADE has been associated with an increase in the total duration of antimicrobial therapy .
Continuing antimicrobials in the absence of infection is likely to cause more harm than stopping them alltogether.
No direct associations between ADE and ecological impact in ICU patients.
The level of evidence showing that ADE reduces AMR is low.
A French group proposed a six-rank consensual classification of beta-lactam antibiotics.
A US group of experts developed a numerical score to measure the spectrum of antimicrobial regimens .
ADE implicitly involves the use of more than one antimicrobial: either the number of antimicrobial is reduced in patients who receive combination antimicrobial therapy initially, or patients are administered two different antimicrobials sequentially.
Two antimicrobials may cause more harm than one, and that patient is exposed to two courses of short duration antimicrobial therapy with a different -and potentially-cumulative damaging effect.
Exposure to cefepime or piperacillin/tazobactam increases the risk of MDR emergence.
Combining antimicrobials in empirical therapy aims at broadening the spectrum of therapy, reducing AMR or creating synergy between drugs.
A better insight into the effect of different antimicrobials on the intestinal flora is needed.
ADE appears as a recommended stewardship objective for antimicrobials, but is not explicitly reported as a major component of ASP .
Post-Prescriptional Review for Antimicrobial Use .
ADE therapy can be reduced to 5-7 days for most infections in ICU patients .
Cultures should not be taken in ICU for ADE .
A rapid diagnostic test detecting MRSA within the first hour after bronchial sampling is associated with a reduction of empirical vancomycin or linezolid .
Practice in subgroups of patients without shock .
Individualisation of antimicrobial treatment based on risk assessment and rapid diagnostics may be a less appealing strategy in institutions with high resistance rates.
ADE may cause an increase in broad-spectrum antibiotic use in these settings .
ADE has been proposed repeatedly as an important objective for ASP in hospitals and it has been selected in a RAND-modified Delphi procedure among experts as 1 of 14 key quality indicators to measure and improve appropriate use in hospital and clinimetric properties.
A hospital's performance on key QIs is increasingly important as hospitals are often publicly and financially punished by healthcare authorities or health insurance companies if they do not meet expectations.
A report on the impact of mandatory ADE reporting on hospital performance.
A high performance on a QI for ADE may only reflect an overuse of empirical broad-spectrum antimicrobials.
Identifying pathogen responsible for infection is critical for ADE, which relies on accurate interpretation of microbiological results in the context of clinical presentation of infection.
Confidence in a sample and its clinical relevance are higher compared to some other situations. Here, the resulting strategy will rely strongly on the microbiological result.
An excellent interaction between intensivists, surgeons, radiologists, microbiologists and infectious diseases physicians is required.
We recommend a clinical strategy that integrates ADE while acknowledging the inherent limitations of this approach.
The planned duration of antimicrobial therapy is also to be considered when antimicrobial Therapy is reevaluated .
Non-severe: with non-severe conditions.
Antimicrobial management strategies integrating antimicrobial de-escalation in clinical practice pulmonary infiltrate are as efficient as a prolonged treatment .
Intermediate-duration antimicrobial therapy using institutional recommendations .
Ranking antibiotics according to local epidemiology and available drugs probably is more important than trying to obtain an international consensus on how antibiotics should be classified.
In patients with confirmed infection and who are deteriorating, a single integrated recommendation is impossible.
In patients with negative cultures, another cause of organ dysfunction should be considered, and antimicrobials should be adapted to the new clinical picture.
ADE should not be used as a 'carte blanche' for the unrestricted use of broad empirical antimicrobial therapy and it is important to recognize that it may have unexpected and unwanted side effects.
In the meantime, ADE should be regarded as an important component of ASPs, as planned duration of therapy, as well as sample quality and relevance need to be incorporated in the decision-making process.

From preconditioning of the heart, thereby leading to a greater likelihood of an uncomplicated postoperative course.
 RIPC attenuated myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury and improved the short-term prognosis of those patients .
The source of the high levels of circulating miRNA-208a before surgery has yet to be determined.
Exposing the heart to abnormal physiological constraints produces a stronger "signal" to provoke a protective mechanism, whatever it may be.

A limitation of our study that bears mention: Our cohort comprises patients with diverse CHDs which necessarily affect their medical parameters.
We have shown that the level of preoperative miRNA-208a in serum is a reliable biomarker for the prediction of patients who are at risk to develop postoperative complications.
Invasive cardiac procedures should be performed in a larger group of patients.

Stress and burnout among mental health professionals .
Stigma among MHPs remains low, with stigma emerging as a key barrier preventing MHPs from seeking help .
Occupational stress can lead to the psychological syndrome of burnout, which is marked by feelings of depletion and overwhelming exhaustion.
Occupational stress and burnout are associated with numerous adverse outcomes for MHPs, their patients, and healthcare systems.
Burnout affects MHPs empathy, communication, therapeutic alliance, and patient engagement .
A review of stigma and help-seeking found that health professionals are more likely to report the experience of stigma as a barrier to help seeking when compared to other professionals.
Not disclosing personal mental health concerns is not a good idea .

Personal Stigma items reflected the personal attitudes MHPs hold towards occupational stress and burnout among MHPs.
Internal consistency of the total MHPSS scale was good, with three of the four subscales also exhibiting acceptable to good internal consistency.
A positive correlation was found between the OMSHC, a measure of stigmatising attitudes and behaviours in health care professionals, and the MHPSS total scale.
The divergent validity of the MHPSS is supported by weak positive correlations between the scale and psychological distress .
Limitations of the current study in terms of validity domains.
Exploring survivor bias in MHPs with burnout.
Recruitment methods such as the use of posts on social media, meant that a response rate for the sample was unable to be determined.
A large sample of female MHPs is needed for further investigation of the scale's structure and validity.
The gender composition of the current sample was not unlike that of the broader MHP population.
The current study contained a number of strengths, in particular, care was taken to ensure MHPs were included in the development and design of the MHPSS, enhancing the validity of the measure.
Initial support for the MHPSS as a valid and reliable measure of stigma towards occupational stress and burnout among MHPs.
The MHPSS may have utility for investigating the interplay of the different stigma types on MHPs' attitudes and perceptions, enabling the development and empirical assessment of interventions that improve help-seeking and mental health among this population.
Endorsement of a stigmatised belief is associated with reduced likelihood of disclosure or help-seeking.
We believe that the MHPSS may be a valuable tool to contribute to the emerging empirical knowledge base on stigmatising attitudes and perceptions of occupational stress and burnout.

Muscle weakness in the intensive care unit can be due to primary neuromuscular disorders that trigger the need for intensive care, such as Guillain-Barré Syndrome, myasthenia gravis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or multiple sclerosis.
ICU-acquired weakness is typically generalized, symmetrical, and affects limb and respiratory muscles, whereas facial and ocular muscles are spared.

We here review the current insights into the pathophysiology, diagnostic tools, risk factors, short-and longterm consequences and management of ICU-acquired weakness.
The pathophysiology of ICU-acquired weakness remains incompletely understood, part explained by practical and ethical issues complicating the study of underlying mechanisms in human patients.
A Conceptual Framework for Loss of Muscle Function .
The catabolic state of critical illness, with reduced anabolic effector hormones and increased catabolic hormones, explain the pronounced muscle wasting that contributes to weakness of myogenic origin in ICU patients .
Hypoperfusion can compromise perfusion and oxygen delivery, and contribute to neuronal injury, axonal degeneration, and to chronic membrane depolarization.
 mitochondrial dysfunction in critical illness appears explained by impaired oxygen utilization, due to direct mitochondrial damage further aggravated by inflammation, hyperglycemia and free radicals.
Autophagy activation during critical illness allows accumulation of damage to mitochondria and other cellular components . Impaired clearance of such damage results in degenerative changes which compromise muscle function.

Cisatracurium with deep sedation tended to increase the risk of ICU-acquired weakness as compared with absence of routine neuromuscular blockade.
Immobility and bed rest in the absence of sedation is difficult .
The development and severity of ICU-acquired weakness are independently associated with higher risk of in-ICU and in-hospital death .
Limb muscle weakness at extubation is independently associated with ICU-acquired weakness.
Neuromuscular weakness has been suggested as a key mechanism contributing to ICU-acquired swallowing disorders.
Weakness status is not a sole determinant of whether a patient can be discharged from the ICU, as this decision is based on the patient no longer being dependent on vital organ support.

One-year survival is lower for weak patients as compared with not-weak patients.
Partially explained less need for prolonged mechanical ventilation, which suggested an impact on clinically relevant ICU-acquired respiratory muscle weakness.
Early full nutrition, preferentially via the enteral route but otherwise supplemented via the parenteral route, is no longer recommended.
Early parenteral nutrition to caloric targets increased complications and delayed recovery of critically ill adults and children.
Amino acids, but not glucose or lipids, appeared to be the culprit in RCTs investigating amino acid supplementation .
Early full enteral feeding is unable to improve impaired physical function 1 year after ICU admission as compared with early hypocaloric feeding .
Increasing the availability of ketone bodies protected against sepsis-induced muscle weakness in mice.
Active Mobilization and Rehabilitation for ICU-acquired Weakness .

 supplementation with vitamin D in the acute phase of the injury has favourable effects on the level of consciousness and duration of mechanical ventilation in the early phase of severe TBI.
Breathing is generated by the rhythmic discharge of groups of neurons located in the brainstem which produces a neural signal directed to respiratory muscles to generate inspiratory effort and tidal breathing .
A feedback reflex mediated by afferents from central and peripheral chemoreceptors aimed at minimizing fluctuations of the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide and pH and correcting hypoxemia.
The descending input is a feed-forward pathway from cortical brain centres and is responsible for adaptive changes of breathing pattern during complex activities, such as physical exercise and mental tasks.
In physiological studies, the response of the subject to raised PaCO 2 level is assessed by measuring the increase in minute ventilation.
The point of equilibrium will lie at the intersection between neural drive and the metabolic hyperbola, which, instead, is the relationship between ventilation and the resultant PaCO 2.
The brain curve, the ventilation curve and the metabolic hyperbola are all potentially modified in ARDS.
Metabolic hyperbola, brain and ventilation curves in health and ARDS.
The brain curve describes the minute ventilation theoretically requested by the neural respiratory drive for a given PaCO 2 .
In ARDS, the metabolic hyperbola is shifted upward due to increase of dead space and VCO 2 .
Chemoreceptors increase the neural respiratory drive in response to more severe hypoxemia.
ARDS might be associated with alterations of neural respiratory drive induced by mechanisms specifically associated with lung inflammation and altered mechanics.
Vagal activation leads to an increase in respiratory rate with a decrease in tidal volume .
The figure shows the key triggers of respiratory drive and the anatomic targets where these triggers exert their effects.
Wall compliance increase the elastic load and can alter the neuro-mechanical coupling between effort and diaphragmatic excursion.
Anxiety and fear can influence the respiratory drive in ARDS patients.
Poor patient-ventilator interaction is another determinant of drive in subjects with ARDS on mechanical ventilation.
The more severe the lung injury, the higher the inspiratory effort reflecting increased activation of neural respiratory drive .
A fundamental difference between ARDS patients and healthy subjects is that ventilatory response may not mirror the respiratory drive .
In the presence of muscular weakness, high drive may be associated with "normal" or even low effort and the resulting motor output.
First, tidal response, reflected by the tidal volume and respiratory rate .
Low muscle strength and the ratio of actual EAdi to maximum E adi measured during an occlusion may provide an accurate estimate of the patient neural respiratory drive and effort to breathe .
A mismatch between the respiratory load and the muscle capacity with decreased expiratory time.
Indices based on the pressure developed by the respiratory muscles, such as oesophageal pressure swings and respiratory muscle pressure , allow reliable quantification of inspiratory effort determined by the neural respiratory drive .

A reliable index of neuromuscular transmission .
Breathing pattern as surrogate for respiratory drive in spontaneously breathing ARDS patients .
Increasing respiratory compliance and muscular weakness may limit the increase in V t in ARDS .
High respiratory drive due to mechanical load or metabolic demand results in a reduction of the physiologic variability of breathing .
Multilevel assessment of respiratory drive for dyspnea .
Dyspnea as multiple sensory feedbacks from the chemoreceptors and the mechanoreceptors .
Neural respiratory drive based on neural output more closely reflect the neural respiratory drive.
Use of partially supported ventilation in ARDS patients could entail the advantage of decreasing sedation, improving hemodynamics and preserving respiratory muscle function.
Regional injury can still occur even in the presence of protective V t and pressure .
Breathing effort increases negative pleural pressure, which promotes additional pulmonary oedema due to increased lung perfusion.
High inspiratory effort due to excess inspiratory load might induce diaphragm inflammation .
Early use of neuromuscular blocking agents in ARDS can improve diaphragm function .
Control of respiratory drive in ARDS using increased ventilation feedback .
High respiratory drive, either appropriate or inappropriate, should be controlled if it results in the generation of excessive lung stress with consequent increased risk of P-SILI.
Multiple strategies are available to modulate the respiratory drive and/or effort in ARDS patients, according to the underlying causes and mechanisms.
Respiratory drive is a hallmark of acute respiratory failure, with the acute onset of dyspnea as the main presenting symptom.
NIV may decrease respiratory drive by several mechanisms: unloading respiratory muscles from inspiratory effort, which also reduces CO 2 production.
Competing physiologic effects of NIV and CPAP on respiratory drive .
Deep sedation and neuromuscular blockade can reduce the respiratory drive and, occasionally, eliminate breathing effort .
A large dissociation between the brain and ventilation curves can be maintained even in the presence of increased neural respiratory drive .
High inspiratory flow can still generate occult pendelluft and regional overdistension .

Respiratory drive increases when the ventilator support is reduced.
Tolerable in order to comply with the patient respiratory drive during PSV: switching back to controlled ventilation might be safer when inspiratory plateau pressure is higher than 30 cmH 2 O.
Increasing ventilator and inspiratory pressure increases only up to a point below safe thresholds, likely because of preserved reflexes limiting lung volumes.
A mode that allows unsupported spontaneous breaths at two pressure levels .
Medications that induce respiratory depression are commonly used for analgo-sedation in ICU patients, However, as most of these medications are associated with short-and long-term adverse effects, their use should be minimized and their effects closely monitored.
Respiratory depression induced by opioids in critically ill patients on assisted ventilation .
Opioids have limited effect in controlling respiratory drive and the risk of P-SILI in ARDS patients.
Propofol and other general anaesthetics reduce the respiratory drive and have been tested in intubated ICU patients, with Propofol showing a more pronounced respiratory depressive effect.
 ICU patients compared to placebo in the first week of treatment .
Using benzodiazepines to suppress respiratory drive might not be an optimal approach in most patients.
 neuromuscular blocking agents can induce a sudden uncoupling between respiratory drive and muscular efficiency .
Neural drive will simply move the metabolic hyperbola downward, thus reducing the actual PaCO 2 .
Control of respiratory drive with ECCO 2 R systems in patients with ARDS .
Respiratory drive may represent a unique synthesis of complex pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying and accompanying ARDS.
Dengue is the most frequent arboviral disease in the tropics and subtropics and poised to increase even further in terms of incidence and continued geographic expansion .
The pathomechanism of severe dengue is still poorly understood, although the most plausible hypothesis is antibody-dependent enhancement in secondary infections .

Informed consent is a critical factor in any discussion and subsequent decision.
Ethical issues surrounding equality of sharing credit for research that involves international partners .
A group of medical journal editors set such strict guidelines that important contributors are relegated to acknowledgment rather than authorship.
International collaborators must be intentional in including African colleagues in research projects from the planning stages through the completion, data analysis, and final written reports.
Rwanda Ministry of Health documents state that in the event that the PI is foreign, the Rwandan collaborator be a co-PI on any publication, consistent with the guidelines for authorship addressed in the Roles and Responsibilities of Investigators document.
Rwanda requires a minimum of 30% of its research investigation teams to be Rwandan.

Services for the second: services for the first.
Challenges at three levels: system level, agency level, and client level.
TSPs described challenges related to four primary contextual characteristics of the child welfare system: numerous involved parties, an overwhelmed work environment, the legal intersection, and system instability.
The challenge of encountering numerous involved parties was the most prevalent theme across focus groups.
TSPs faced barriers communicating in ways as fundamental as knowing 'who is who' among the variety of professionals involved with child welfare clients.
TSPs consistently emphasized the importance of interprofessional communication for case trajectory.
Information sharing among professionals in foster care cases, particularly with expressions of frustration.
 shared, TSPs specifically expressed being at a disadvantage therapeutically.
We need to also provide the case plan…so that we can all kind of be on the same page.

A push for quantity over quality in agency expectations interferes with therapeutic quality.
Survivor of the fittest: A nurse's perspective on taking a five-year-old on a waitlist .
Pressure for productivity hours results in providing services in ways they would otherwise avoid:
We are so desperate to make hours, we go like 'Okay, I will see you at 8pm, okay I will See you at seven.'
TSPs commonly expressed feeling discouraged and an element of guilt due to being spread so thin given the expectations, including not being able to individualize sessions and practice therapy in the way they would like.
TSPs in child welfare have expressed frustration with the lack of time they have to plan and personalize their therapy.
In the first of a series of articles on the state of productivity in the United States, I address the issue of required productivity hours.
I've been told that if I spend time helping a homeless client, then I'm spending time taking away from other productivity, and I'm going to get screwed for that.

Four challenges were identified at the client level in analysis given that each was experienced by TSPs in their engagement with clients.
Clients are overwhelmed, confused, and uninformed TSPs.
In private practice, they are seeking your services versus child welfare, but they don't really know who you are.
TSPs expressed that parents routinely lack an understanding of the processes involved.
Parents are really confused, too, because they don't know what's going on.
TSPs described having to take on educational and liaison roles between parents and child protective services.
To be connected to the challenge of having numerous involved parties and the legal intersection at the system level, suggesting that challenges manifest differently and impact TSPs in multifaceted ways.

An elevated MCV may represent myelodysplastic syndrome or clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential .
RDW was one of the most significant predictors of hospital and post-discharge mortality in this CICU cohort and appeared to be more strongly associated with mortality among patients without anemia, even though patients with anemia had higher RDW.
An elevated RDW was associated with lower long-term survival in critically ill patients.
A strong independent relationship between RDW and mortality .
Elevated RDW in the CICU increases mortality risk independent of anemia .
We focused on admission laboratory values to predict mortality and were not able to determine whether changes in these variables during hospitalization influenced mortality risk.

An additional mediation model, with sensitivity analyses, is proposed.
The mediation effect of trust in government on the partisan H1N1 safety gap using two additional models.
Government significantly mediates the partisan gap, and government models are modestly sensitive to pretreatment covariates.
I chose these two additional mediation models because mediation sensitivity analysis is available only for linear/linear, linear/binomial probit/linear mediation models . As such, in conjunction with the linear/ linear model presented in the body of the paper, I have comprehensively tested the sensitivity of my mediation analysis
Perception of vaccine safety mediated the partisanship effect on vaccination decision, and compare it to the mediator effect of disease worry.
The multiple mediation model allows me to test both pathways simultaneously and see whether one or both significantly mediate the effect of partisanship on vaccination decision.
A simple mediation model which examined the mediation effect of concern about a terrorist attack involving smallpox on the partisan difference in smallpox vaccination.
Worry about a terrorist attack involving smallpox was not a significant mediator of the effect of partisanship on decision to vaccinate.
A new report from the US Department of Health and Human Services suggests that the Obama administration was more worried about H1N1 than the state of the economy.
The case of measles was similar to the case of H1N1, where concern about the disease did not significantly mediate the effect of partisanship on vaccination decision.
Safety of the vaccine, rather than danger of the disease.

A partisan perspective on vaccine safety and its effect on vaccination rates.
Partisan Vaccination Gap in the United States .
A review of the findings of a study on the role of the human brain in learning and memory.
Polarization influences partisans' willingness to follow government recommendations by reducing their trust in government.
Partisans would be mistrustful of the federal government when the opposing party is at its' helm.
In highly polarized political environments, partisans are unlikely to trust the out-party .
Presidential visibility is the most compelling reason for partisans to focus on the party of the president, rather than control of Congress, when deciding whether or not to trust the government.
People will be more likely to follow government regulations when their party is in power because they are morelikely to cooperate with entities that they trust.
Exchanges when they were framed as a free market alternative .
Distrust in government authority is a well-known predictor of compliance with government recommendations and interventions in a variety of arenas.
Democrats and Republicans today may not be as large as those between lower and upper class Britons in the 19th century, but they still can have a strong influence on government trust.
Partisan media cuing effects pose a possible alternative explanation for the partisan vaccination gap.
Partisan selective exposure is more common than affiliation, while other find that partisan selective exposure .
Co-Partisans are more likely to accept government recommendations than presidential out-partisans.
In this paper, I use causal mediation to explore the relationship between government trust, partisanship, and vaccination.
A look at vaccination behavior in the United States.
I use survey data to measure two quantities of interest-perceptions of vaccine safety and reported willingness to receive the vaccine.
Adult survey respondents tend to accurately report their own vaccination status and Zell et al.
No evidence that partisans engage in expressive reporting about vaccine safety on surveys.
We don't know how long it will take, but we do know that it won't be long.
The independent category was limited to pure independents -leaners were categorized with their respective party.
I use an ordered logistic model with controls for age, gender, race, income and education to measure the effect of partisanship on perceptions of vaccine safety.
The effect size of partisanship on perceptions of vaccine safety and willingness to vaccinate.
I look at three cases of partisan vaccination gaps, where Democrats and Republicans switch their perceptions of vaccine safety and willingness to vaccinate.
Partisan leaners behave similarly to partisans of the party they lean towards.
Perceptions of vaccine safety were measured using several questions from an April 2003 Harvard School of Public Health SARS survey .
Willingness to Vaccinate: A Gallup/CNN/USA Today poll .
Perceptions of H1N1 vaccine safety were measured using several questions from the nationally representative October 2009 ABC/Washington Post survey.
Willingness to vaccinate against H1N1 was measured with a question from the same ABC/ Washington Post survey, which asked respondents whether they were willing to get vaccinated.
A nationally diverse survey of attitudes toward the measles vaccination.
I used a question from the same survey which asked respondents if they would vaccinate their child for MMR, or if they will seek an exemption.
In this paper, I test the hypothesis that partisanship of the president influences vaccination rates because it makes presidential out-partisans less likely to trust the government.
A causal mediator model which assesses the degree to which government trust explains partisan differences in beliefs about vaccine safety.
Mediation analysis is only one piece of evidence for the partisan trust theory, if mediation analysis failed to find that trust in government is a significant mediator for partisanship in beliefs about vaccination.
I ran a simple mediator model to test if government trust explained partisan differences in perceptions of vaccine safety.
I use the mediation model presented in Imai et al. because it allows the use of non-linear models such as ordered logit in the mediation analysis.
The total effect of partisanship on perceptions of vaccine safety and the causal mediation effect of trust in government.
I use actual vaccination data to determine whether survey differences in perceptions of vaccines translate into actual differences in behavior.
Children are being denied vaccination for any number of reasons such as the presence of a medically recognized condition that precludes vaccination.
Republicans should be less likely to vaccinate after Obama took office, according to my theory.
I used a binomial logit regression with district-level random effects to estimate the effect of school district partisanship on the rate of vaccination and PBEs.
I use two different dependent variables of interest -overall vaccination rates, and personal belief exemption rates.
Parents of young children are more likely to vote Democratic than all other parents.
The state-level correlation between under-5 parent vote and total population vote is about 0.7.
In this model, Y stands in for the two outcome variables - proportion of children in school district i who have a personal belief exemption in year t.
Partisan Perceptions of Vaccine Safety: A Logistic Regression .
In all three cases, presidential co-partisans were significantly more likely to believe that the vaccine was safe.
 independents are less trusting of government than partisans irrespective of which party is in power.
Out-Partisans are more likely than co-partisans to believe that serious illness is "very likely" or "somewhat likely" side effect of the H1N1 vaccine.
Co-Partisans are more confident in the safety of vaccines than presidential out-partisans .
From 4% for measles vaccine to 11% for smallpox vaccine.
I use a model analogous to the ordered logistic regression presented in the previous section, where both the mediator and outcome variables are treated as ordered factors.
Government trust is a significant mediator of partisan vaccination gap in perceptions of vaccine safety.
The mediation effect of government trust on the partisan gap in vaccine safety perceptions.
Government trust significantly mediates the effect of partisanship on perceptions of safety.
A sensitivity analysis performed on these results using the methodology described by Imai et al. shows a modest degree of sensitivity to unobserved pre-treatment covariates.
Presidential co-partisans are more likely to vaccinate their children against smallpox and H1N1.
In all three cases, presidential co-partisans were significantly more likely to vaccinate than presidential out-Partisans.
President Barack Obama's election increased the number of PBEs in the US, and vaccination rates fell.
Republicans are more likely to vaccinate their children than presidential out-partisans.
In this section, I tackle threats to the validity of my behavioral results.
In this paper, I relied on county-level disease data from the California Health and Human Services Department to get the lagged vaccine preventable disease rate.
Using the lagged disease rate variable in the regression should remove the significance on the Dem vote x Obama admin term.
Lagging the disease rate at 0, 2, or 3 years instead of 1.5 years is still significant.
The second test concerns a potential "catch up" effect among under-vaccinated school districts.
The partisan effect of vaccination rates and PBEs does not change the partisan effect, nor does removing the interaction between Obama admin and the lagged variable.
An interaction term between Obama admin x median household income and anti-vaccine sentiment .
The observed partisan effect is unlikely to be the result of income effects.
 partisan vaccination behavior is robust to disease, "catch up," and income effects, further demonstrating that the observed change in partisan vaccination rates was the result of a switch in the party of the presidency.
Are presidential out-partisans less likely to comply with government recommendations?
Partisan differences in government trust significantly mediated partisan differences in perceptions of vaccine safety, These findings carry important implications for public health campaigns in the era of polarization.
Viewing these agencies through an explicitly partisan lens, this could have serious repercussions for vaccination initiatives in the US.
Political partisanship has emerged as a key predictor of Americans' political behaviors, but of their non-political ones as well.

Density of Ignorants, Spreaders 1, Spreader 2 and Removers with k i degree in group i at time t.
We assume that the process of rumor spreading is as follows.

Z is the probability of a person with degree k i .
Infectivity of a person with degree k i .
A positive invariant set for model . As a matter of convenience,
We propose a new propagation model with heterogeneous networks and consider the immune mechanism of the ignorants.
Model can be rewritten as z i for i = 1, 2, . . . , n.
M is a bounded compact set for all t ≥ 0.
Lemma 2 can be obtained directly from Lemma 2 in .
In this section, we will analyze the dynamics of model and give some conditions for rumor extinction or persistence.
R 0 depends on the basic reproduction number r 0 .
In order to facilitate the calculation of basic reproduction number of model can be rewritten as follows:
Positive rumor equilibrium point of model is the unique positive rumors equilibrium point.
We prove that the rumor-free equilibrium point E 0 is E 0 .
In the case of r 01 < 1 and r 02 > 1, it has *
We have r 01 > 1 and r 02 > 1, we have *
R 01 and r 02 can be defined as 1 and 1, and the model has a unique positive solution if and only if r 01 > 1.
Rumor Spreader 2 will not die out when rumor Spreader 1 exist.
Two kinds of spreaders exist, and two kinds of Spreaders 1 exist.
Two kinds of rumor spreaders will be extinct when r 0 < 1.
Local stability of rumor-free equilibrium E 0 of model is related to the eigenvalues of the corresponding Jacobian matrix J .
E 0 of model is locally asymptotically stable.
S 1 k i tends to zero as t → +∞.
Lim t→∞ S 2 k i = 0, we can get that for arbitrarily enough small ε 3 > 0, there exists t 3

E 0 is globally asymptotically stable.
A positive solution E + of model satisfies E + .
E + of model converges to E * 1 , i.e., lim E + →E * 1 .

An educational mechanism to control the spread of rumor .
We only need to prove that the spreaders eventually tend to be extinct under the control.
An analysis of the basic reproduction number r * 0.
We know that r * 0 is the condition to decide whether the rumor spreads or is extinct.
The rumor can be effectively restrained when the control intensity of the propagator satisfies model , which is seen in the later numerical simulations.
We propose an event-triggered impulsive control strategy, which only needs to control the rumor spreaders at some discrete instants.
We introduce the event-triggered impulsive control.
The impulsive sequence t k satisfies 0 = t 0 < t 1 < · · · < t k <, and 0 < q < 1 represents the control effect.
The event-trigger function for rumor propagation is defined as
We apply the event-triggered impulsive control to suppress the spreading of rumors in this paper.
Let ξ = θZ for i = 1, 2, . . . , n.
We replace I k i in 1 and 2 with p d+μ, then the new matrices denoted by¯ 1 and¯ 2 , respectively.
The origin of Eq. is globally asymptotically stable under control .
A nonnegative and continuous function on w is nonnegative if the following inequality is satisfied.
A model under the impulsive event-triggered control with the event-trigger function .
Rumor has it that Zeno behavior does not exist.
We construct the following Lyapunov function.
Using condition , one has lim t→∞ S = 0. Then the rumor dies out.
In Theorem 7, the condition of rumor extinction is given.
No Zeno behavior under the event-triggered impulsive control strategy.
T k = t k+1 − t k and t = tk+1 , one can obtain
T k > 0 for any k, i.e., the Zeno behavior is excluded.
The event-triggered impulsive control strategy is used to restrain the spread of rumor in a multilingual environment.
The dynamic characteristic of the proposed rumor propagation model is analyzed by numerical simulation.
This paper considers a rumor propagation model with two languages under heterogeneous networks.
Stability of rumor-free equilibrium point based on Theorem 1 .
Different initial values, different equilibrium points, different infection rates.
Rumors can affect equilibrium point, but do not affect the value of rumor free equilibrium point.
We choose α = 0.5, ρ =0.2, β 1 = 0015, β 2 = 1.0, d = d1, d2 = d2, d3 = d3, d4 = d4, d5 = d5 .

GI barrier dysfunction may be caused by loss of enterocyte integrity, increased transcellular/paracellular permeability, loss of mucus layer integrity and impaired mucosal immunity.
The GI barrier function is the net result of a myriad of interactions between the luminal content, the epithelium and the mucosal immune system . Because any or all of these components may be dysregulated in critical illness, no single biomarker is likely to capture all of them.
Double/triple sugar absorption tests can be affected by GI dysmotility, renal and/or liver impairment, and administration of antibiotics, possibly limiting their usefulness in the critically ill.

An altered microbiome during critical illness is associated with loss of intestinal barrier, which allows the translocation of bacterial products across the mucosa to cause further inflammation and, finally, dysfunction of remote organs.
Infection induced by translocation through disrupted gut epithelium will trigger the administration of fluids and vasopressors.
The microbiome refers to all of the microbial consortia , their genes and gene products , their community structure and the particulars of the environment in which they reside.
Antibiotics and other drugs in the ICU can interfere with the gut microbiome .
The microbiome of critically ill patients undergoes a significant and rapid dysbiosis with loss of diversity, loss of site specificity and a shift toward dominant pathogens as compared to healthy controls.
Gut by antibioticresistant bacteria may occur upon ICU discharge and cessation of SDD .
In animal models, the gut plays a pivotal role in precipitating MODS.
The epithelial cells with all the different phenotypes are the central regulatory components of barrier function and immune homeostasis.
The activation of intestinal macrophages and leucocyte recruitment to the intestinal mucosa may aggravate the intestinal barrier failure .
Molecules secreted from the GI tract may have local effects to modulate motility, mucosal growth and immune function and/or distal hormonal effects on other systems.
Altered bile acid homeostasis in paediatric patients with intestinal failure has been postulated to contribute to liver dysfunction via increased hepatic bile Acid synthesis due to a failing feedback mechanism.
In malabsorption, the reabsorption of bile acids is reduced and the negative feedback for bile acid synthesis is inhibited .
Gut oedema and distension in ICU patients are caused by inflammation and capillary leak, fluid resuscitation and increased venous pressure.
Gut oedema per se may lead to endotoxaemia, impair intestinal motility and healing of bowel anastomoses.
Oedema-induced cell stretch and resulting altered cytoskeleton alterations may explain bowel dysmotility, impaired healing of anastomoses and also endotoxaemiamediated systemic effects.
Interstitial oncotic pressure and the intestinal interstitial space may become a space with high compliance.
Bowel distension relates to expansion through increased intra-luminal pressure.

A look at the state of the NHS in England and Wales.
Elevated sCr levels before surgery were identified as a risk factor for CRRT in our study.
We confirmed the relationship between elevated preoperative sCr and acute aortic dissection.
CPB time is another risk factor for CRRT .
CPB procedure causes damage to endothelial cells, and the resulting cell debris forms tiny emboli that block the renal tubular vascular network.
Reducing CPB duration is more important if CPB is prolonged.
The mortality rate of the CRRT group is significantly higher than that of the control group on 30-day and long term postoperative outcomes.
A meta-analysis of cohort studies found that patients with AKI had higher risk of experiencing chronic kidney disease and endstage renal disease.

An analysis of hospital-based trauma in the United States .
On the state of the economy in the United States.
Data related to patient and hospital information in the JTDB include patient demographics, AIS, ISS, prehospital and in-hospital procedures, and clinical outcomes.
FTR was defined as in-hospital mortality after at least one trauma complication.
We used a logistic regression model to predict the probability of death for each patient at each hospital.
We used a standardized mortality rate [ P c ] at each hospital to determine the hospital ranking.
Distributed, distributed, distributed: that's what it's all about.
We calculated the correlation coefficient between complication rate and FTR and in-hospital mortality in all hospitals.
P values were two-sided, and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
An analysis of the JTDB for adults with trauma .
The mortality rate among trauma patients with any complications was 10.2% .
Interventions in trauma patients according to hospital ranking .
High-mortality hospitals have significantly lower expected mortality than low-m mortality hospitals.
The correlation coefficient between complication rate and in-hospital mortality was 0.2728 for hospitals contributing at least 20 patients with complications to the cohort complications and0.2727 in all hospitals .
High-performing trauma hospitals could be related to a lower risk of complications and rescue from a complication.
In-hospital mortality among trauma patients with complications was almost two times more in high-m mortality hospitals compared to low-mortality hospitals, similar to a previous study .
Lower complication rate and lower FTR related to patient's better outcomes .
FTR is a reasonable measure of hospital quality that is strongly related to mortality.
We found that trauma complications and mortality are not correlated at hospital level .
Management of inpatients after trauma such as pneumonia is important, even if they did not undergo surgery.
High-mortality hospitals had more emergency procedures but fewer surgeries.
We captured trivial complications compared to other previous FTR studies, but these complications did not show clinical difference according to hospital performance of trauma care.
A retrospective observational study on non-trauma patients showed that low FTR hospitals had significantly more staffing resources than high F TR hospitals .
A team-based multidisciplinary approach could play an important role in trauma care by reducing judgment errors and delays in diagnosis of trauma .
Correlation between failure-to-rescue and in-hospital mortality among patients with trauma in hospitals .
In all hospitals underestimation or misclassification of complications to JTDB is plausible.

A discussion of our results in Sec. VII, where technical details relevant to Sec. III and IV have been relegated.
We formulate the model first at the microscale, and from this derive a mesoscopic version of the model where the variables are continuous and represent the fractions of types of individuals who are infected or who are susceptible to infection.
In this paper, we introduce a dynamic network for infection and recover from infection.
An individual is labeled according to whether it is susceptible, infected, or recovered, and the degree of the node where it is located.
The properties of an epidemic that takes place over a shorter time frame than demographic processes.
Interactions between individuals are the only interactions between the individuals to be:
Infection of an individual at a node of degree k.
The summation is over infected individuals labeled according to the degree of the node on which they are located.
Recovery of infected individual at a node of degree k proceeds at a rate given by γ .
The dynamics of the process can be described by writing down an equation for the probability that the system is in a state {S l ,I l |l = 1, . . . ,K} at time t.
The discrete model defined by Eqs. l and l is completely determined, and P can be found for any state.
We approximate the master equation to obtain models that are more amenable to analysis.
A mesoscopic description of the process involves going over to new variables s k = S k /N, k = 1, . . . ,K, which are assumed continuous for large N , but retaining the stochastic nature of the system.
The construction of the mesoscopic model involves expanding the master equation, Eq. , in powers of 1/N and truncating this expansion at order O.
We have introduced the functions A μ and B μν.
The mesoscopic form of the model is to adopt a coarser time scale by introducing a new time variable τ.
P implies a nontrivial deterministic dynamics.

We start by looking at the deterministic limit of the system, and we start to reduce the number of equations.
A set of stable fixed points with i * k = 0 and s * k undetermined, for all k.
The fixed point is uniquely determined, however, it may not be stable.
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of J {2K} are straightforward to determine.
A degenerate set of eigenvalues can be found by equating the trace of J {2K} to the sum of its eigen Values.
The condition for the fixed points to be stable is a suitable set of corresponding eigenvectors.
In the general heterogeneous case, a negligible or a significant number of individuals in the population will get infected during the course of the epidemic.
We look first at the homogeneous case, where K = 1.
We define an epidemic threshold, such that for R 0 > 1 the number of infectives grows exponentially in the early stages of the epidemic and its final state corresponds to = ∼ .
We can integrate the equation above to find an initial condition i 0 1, with s 0 ∼ 1.
S * = 1 is always a solution, and the only one for R 0 < 1.
This paper reduces the 2K dynamical equations to two equations, which consider the static case).
We introduce new variables K k=1 k 2 d k x k .
We argue that where a nonnetwork epidemic can have its dynamics represented in phase space with coordinates ,i), for the network model the physically relevant "test node" has avoided infection at time τ .
Coordinates, designed to account for link heterogeneity, are ,λ).
In this reduced model, there is a line of stable fixed points, uniquely determined by the initial conditions, which satisfy λ * = 0.
The stability matrix for the full system given by Eq. .
We can find analogous expressions to those in Eqs. and for the heterogeneous case.
A completely susceptible population will correspond to θ being equal to unity.
 ρ is the heterogeneous basic reproductive ratio, generalizing R 0 = β/γ in the homogeneous case.
In order to find the heterogeneous final size, we proceed again as in the homogeneous case.
We set an initial condition with a very small number of infectives, λ 0 1, in an almost completely susceptible population, and the final state is given by the smallest solution to the initial condition.
A stochastic analysis of the heterogeneous basic reproductive ratio.
Using the Ansatz s k = d k θ k, we arrive at the ∞ limit.
We take the equation for the i k variables, multiply it by k and sum over k, to obtain
Noise terms appearing in the equation for λ above have zero mean; also, it can be readily verified that all three of them are given by δB μν .
We can now, as in Sec. II, express ξ 1 ,ξ 2 and ξ 3 in terms of three independent normally distributed random variables, ζ 1 , ζ 2 , and ζ 3 .
The stochastic system of equations cannot be closed.
A very-high-dimensional model of epidemic dynamics, in which K can take very large values, is rendered impractical, even after reducing the number of equations.
Partial Reduction in the deterministic case for stochastic treatment.
A new stability matrix with fixed points corresponding to diseasefree states, but with θ undetermined.
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be found in the same way as before, the eigenvalues having the
The stochastic epidemic is a closed two-dimensional system of equations, thus enormously complicating the analysis of its deterministic limit.
We exploit the properties of the deterministic limit of the model and find a way to close the equations in the finite-N case, while still retaining the essential features of the full model.
In the case of a large epidemic, the deterministic dynamics would quickly evolve along the directions corresponding to the set of most negative eigenvalues toward a lower-dimensional region of the state space, in which the system as a whole evolves in a much slower time scale, and which contains the fixed point

On the slow subspace, where it seems to stay during the rest of the course of the epidemic.
Eigenvectors v {k} of the Jacobian at the fixed point, defined in Eq. l=1 lψ l = 0.
We find that the system possesses a line of fixed points, which is quickly approached at early times, dominated by the deterministic dynamics, and along which the slow, stochastic dynamics takes place.
We parametrize the slow subspace using the coordinates z 1 ≡ u · x and z 2 ≡ u {K+1} · x.
A linear transformation of Eqs. II and III leads to a closed set of equations in θ and λ.
We propose a stochastic set of SDEs which can be expressed entirely in terms of the slow variables z 1 and z 2 .
We expect that we should be able to effectively reduce the stochastic system from dimensions to two dimensions, by neglecting the fast initial behavior of the epidemic.
A closed system of stochastic differential equations for θ and λ.
We compare the dynamics of the full microscopic model, defined by Eq. -, to that of the reduced mesoscopic model above.
The microscopic model are rather smooth, and are dominated by a horizontal spread due to the fact that the epidemic takes off at different moments.
Better agreement between the full and reduced models for smaller values of θ * , corresponding to larger .
The reduced mesoscopic model does not provide a good approximation to microscopic dynamics in this case, since K is of the order of N.
The reduced stochastic system has a degenerate eigenvalue equal to −γ throughout the time evolution.
This paper compares the value ofσ 3 in terms of the i k to the one in the deterministic limit and sees that the approximation is not very good.

We obtain the distribution of r ∞ from the full model via a Sellke construction , and note that it is characterized by two regions: one to left of the interval, corresponding to early extinctions, and one to right corresponding to the epidemic taking off.
We would not expect diffusion approximation to capture extinction probabilities accurately, given that its derivation implicitly assumes that the infective population is large and extinctions by definition involve small numbers of infectives.
We make an argument related to "susceptibility sets" in probability .
We have already calculated the probability of early extinction of the epidemic starting with an individual picked uniformly at random from a very large population.

Low-dimensional systems are accurate approximations to microscopic models, except in the case where K approaches N , although this is to be expected since our derivation of the diffusion limit implicitly assumes that K N .
We have shown that the main inaccuracy of the reduction, relating to very early extinction probabilities of the epidemic, can be dealt with using a simple argument.

The marginal prior is obtained by integrating over all remaining parameters weighted by their respective prior distributions.
This paper uses the observed functional behavior of edges as an additional source of evidence for the reconstruction task.

Antigenic drift causes new viruses emerging as a result of antigenic shift.
The 1918 pandemic influenza virus killed healthy adults between 15 and 34 years.
The antigenic shift in the influenza A strain to H2 and N2 resulted in a severe pandemic causing approximately 1 million deaths worldwide.

Future research should identify synergies between reducing extinction and other risks.
We propose a framework for discussing extinction risks, and use this framework to improve our understanding of extinction risk.
Human extinction is also possible, even this century.
We consider three different ways of classifying such risks.
We identify three phases in an extinction process at which people may intervene. We ask how people could stop the process.
An event causing human extinction would be unprecedented, so is likely to have some feature or combination of features that is without precedent in human history.
Some damaging processes pose risks of extinction, but many do not.
We suggest that much of the difference can usefully be explained by three broad defence layers.
First layer: prevention. Second layer: response.
People can recover from a catastrophe, even if most of them die.
The boundaries between these different types of risk-reducing activity aren't crisp, and one activity may help at multiple stages.
Resilience as reducing the likelihood that a severe global catastrophe eventually causes human extinction.
We can classify damaging processes by the way in which we could stop them at the defence layers.
We define three classes of risk, one of which is malicious, the other is cascading, and the last is endgame.
In this paper, we present implications of our framework distinguishing three layers.
Global catastrophes can cause extinction, but what can be done to prevent it?
We ask why a risk might break through a defence layer, and look for answers that abstract away from the specific system affected.
We believe the two classifications complement each other well, and hope that our coarser typology can guide the search for additional critical systems and spread mechanisms.
We identify clusters of engineered pandemics that can best be reduced by different policy levers even if both affected the same critical systems.
Our classification also overlaps with the one by Liu et al.
Avin et al. and extinction risks by definition involve risks of a massive loss of lives.
An assessment of the existential risks to human existence .
The origin of a risk determines how it passes through the prevention layer, and hence the kind of steps society can take to strengthen prevention .
We sometimes can take steps to avoid natural risks. For example, we may be able to develop methods for deflecting asteroids.
All non-natural risks are anthropogenic, but we can classify them further.
In this paper we explore the relationship between the number of people needed and the properties of things close to this boundary.
In the end, it wasn't much, but it was a start.
Small groups may pose Anthropogenic risks from small groups.
The case of a risk where relatively few people are involved in triggering and they are unaware of the potential harm is an unseen risk.
An engineered pathogen from an experiment despite safety precautions.
We have a malicious risk where a small group of people wants to do widespread damage.
We ask why many people would pursue an activity which causes global damage. Perhaps they do not know about the damage.
Fossil fuel use contributed to climate change, and continued fossil fuel use triggers a truly catastrophic shift in climate.
A commons risk is a failure to internalise negative externalities, so we call this a commons risk.
In most conflicts, actors are intentionally causing harm, but only as an instrumental goal.
We classify risks according to who creates the risk and their state of knowledge.
Incorporating the possibility of being found culpable is an important incentive for avoiding risk-causing activities and part of risk management in most societies.
We need research aimed at identifying potential hazards, understanding their dynamics, and eventually develop ways to reduce their rate of occurrence.
We can promote norms such as appropriate risk management principles at institutions that engage in plausibly risky activities, enabling us to develop targeted prevention measures.
A new way that warnings of newly discovered risks reach decision-makers .
Accidents may be prevented by general safety norms that also help reduce unseen risk.
We can leverage market incentives to reduce the expected damages of accidents through mechanisms such as insurance.
Solving the coordination problems at the heart of commons and conflict risks is sometimes possible by fostering national or international cooperation.
We can prevent malicious risks by combating extremism, and we can help with governance challenges in this area.
Our classification by origin is aimed at identifying policies that wouldif successfully implementedreduce a broad class of risks.
Classification by scaling mechanism: types of response failure .
We can look at the scaling process and determine whether or not there is leverage in play.
We define catastrophes of an immediately global scale as large sudden-onset natural disasters such as asteroid strikes.
Leverage points for rapid one-step scaling can be located in natural systems, for example if the extinction of a key species caused an ecosystem to collapse.
Risks of both natural and anthropogenic origin may interact with such systems.
Responding to leverage risks is challenging because there are only few opportunities to intervene.
Cascading risks normally cascade in a way which does not rely on humans deciding to further the effects.
Cascading risks give us more opportunities to respond, and that response will therefore be an important component of risk reduction.
Reducing the rate of propagation is also effective if there exist other interventions that can eventually stop or revert the damage.
Impede cooperation: by preventing a coordinated response, the likelihood of a global catastrophe is increased.
Not obviously present a risk: the longer a cascading risk is under-recognised, the more it can develop before any real response.
Be on extreme timescales: if the risk presents and cascades very fast, there is little opportunity for any response.
Policy implications for responding to extinction risk • By their nature, we cannot respond to large risks before they become a global catastrophe.
Leverage risks provide us with the opportunity of a leveraged response: we can identify leverage points in advance and target our responses at them.
Three general recommendations for responding to cascading risks.
A global catastrophe must in the end stop the survival of the species .
In order to kill everyone, the catastrophe must reach everyone.
A vector risk is a direct risk to a population that people have carried along with them.
We would have to be extraordinarily unlucky to reach everyone by chance.
By accident, by accident, the UK government introduces a policy that kills people by accident.
We can reduce our long-term ability to survive, but we can break them up according to the kind of ability it impedes.
Habitat risks make long-term survival impossible.
Capability risks knock us back in a way that permanently remove an important societal capability, leading in the long run to extinction.
We are gesturing towards a distinction between habitat risks and capability risks, rather than drawing a sharp line.
The loss of fragile but important capabilities, and the loss of the ability to recover them.
An important type of capability risk may be civilisational collapse.
On the other hand, if even large amounts of destruction have only small effects on the chances of eventual extinction, it becomes more important to focus on risks which otherwise get past the resilience layer.
We finally illustrate our completed classification scheme by applying it to examples, which we summarise in Table 1 .
We've called this a natural risk regarding its origin; a large risk regarding scale, with no opportunity to intervene between the asteroid impact and its damage affecting the whole globe.
Risks with the same salient central mechanismin this case nuclear warmay well differ during other phases.
In the first scenario, war is used as leverage to remove a crucial capability rather than via damage to its habitat.
Unseen risk; the scaling would be via leverage if we assume a discrete algorithmic improvement as trigger, or alternatively the risk could be rapidly cascading.
To guard against what today would be ubiquity risks, we may in the future have to establish human settlements on other planets .
Establishing disaster shelters in isolated and self-sufficient communities may hence be an attractive option.
Resilience against vector and agency risks is increased by late-stage response measures that work even in the event of widespread damage to infrastructure and the breakdown of social structure.
We use our guiding idea of three defence layers to present a way of calculating the extinction probability posed by a given risk.
We study the probability that a given risk R will cause human extinction in a specific timeframe, say by 2100.
R gets past the first barrier and causing a catastrophe, given that it has passed the second barrier.
P = c, g, and e when all three terms are non-negligible.
We ask which of c, g, and e we can halve most often.
On the extinction probability phalving either of c, g, or e will halve p.
We are better off reducing probabilities not close to 100%.
We don't have to do much to reduce the risk at the scaling stage, because the probability g is close to 1.
A strategy of defence in depth, our third conclusion, is optimal if and only if we can spend relatively
This is a very long list of things that happened in the first half of the year.
We do hope that our work could prove foundational for further research that investigates both the allocation between risks and between defence layers simultaneously.
We have not considered interactions between different defence layers or different risks .
The most important extinction risks to act on are those that have a non-negligible chance of breaking through all three defence layers.
Investing in prevention, response, and resilience with diminishing marginal returns.
We have considered ways of classifying threats that may cause human extinction and the pathways through which they may do so.
Giving centre stage to the defence layers provides the following useful lens for extinction risk management.
We can increase our capacity to prevent, respond to, or be resilient against one risk; for example, we can research methods to deflect asteroids.
Risk factors need not be associated with any potential proximate cause of extinction.
Getting hit by a global catastrophe followed in short succession by another might be enough to cause extinction when neither alone would have done so.
A previous terrorist attack on another airport caused congestion due to rerouted planes, which disabled the prevention measure of using separate routes for taxiing and takeoff .
Our capacity to defend also depends on various structural properties that can change in gradual ways even in the absence of particularly conspicuous events.
Risk Factors: A Survey of Risk Factors .
The allocation of resources between layers defending against specific risks, which we investigated in section 2, is not necessarily the most central task of extinction risk management.
The study and management of extinction risks are challenging for several reasons.
We propose a system for analysing and prioritising between several extinction risks, in order to focus attention on the most crucial aspects.

NPC1L1 mediates the uptake of dietary cholesterol at the surface of the intestinal epithelium and is an alternative to statins for patients with elevated plasma cholesterol.
NPC2 group and transfers it to the N-terminal domain of NPC1 .
The availability of the structures of NPC2 , NPC1 N-terminal domain , lumenal domains 2 and 3 and the full length NPC1 by cryoelectron microscopy has catapulted our understanding to a new level.
NPC1 N-terminal domain uses the flexibility of a poly-proline linker to transfer cholesterol to a cavity detected on the other side of the protein.
NPC1 domains that receive cholesterol from NPC2 are located~80 Å from the membrane bilayer.
NPC1 functions by conformational transformations rather than via a sterol hand-off pathway restricted to the N-terminal domain.
Itraconazole for NPC1 protein .
PFO* is a protein that binds cholesterol and can be used to quantitate cholesterol levels in cells lacking NPC1 protein .
We synchronized the cholesterol release process in cells expressing rescue constructs by addition of the NPC1-specific inhibitor, U18666A.

NPC1 P251C/L929C/P249K/P259K would be predicted to yield disulfide-bonded peptides.
To C929 in NPC1's C-terminal domain.
We label any free cysteines in NPC1 P251C/L929C/P249K/P259K with either 12 C 2 H 2 or 13 C 2 D 2 iodoacetamide prior to reduction, enabling us to quantify precisely the fraction of NPC1 protein with a
Control experiments using either light/light or heavy/heavy iodoacetamide in both the first and second rounds of labeling provided 'standard' spectra for the possible peptide products.
NPC1 C251 and C929 were protected from heavy iodoacetamide labeling prior to chemical reduction-indicating they are disulfide-bonded.

A mutant of NPC1 -/-HeLa cells that can be co-localized with endogenous LAMP1.
D807-811-mouse NPC1 could not rescue the cholesterol accumulation seen in NPC1 -/-HeLa cells, as determined by immuno-fluorescence light microscopy and quantitative flow cytometry.

The 807-811Ala mutant protein fully rescued cholesterol accumulation in lysosomes of NPC1 -/transfected cells, monitored by immunofluorescence light microscopy and quantitative flow cytometry .
A small truncation of five amino acids in protein helices is necessary for mobility, with cytoplasmically oriented residues contributing.
Cholesterol cross-linked NPC1 peptides also lie across the interface of the MLD and CTD , suggesting that after binding to the N-terminal domain, cholesterol might traverse between interface residues . If so, locking these domains together with a precisely localized disulfide bond should block NPC1
Disulfide bond formation of A521C peptide in reduced samples .
A521C/K1013C-NPC1 failed to rescue cholesterol accumulation in NPC1 -/transfected HeLa cells, monitored by immunofluorescence light microscopy and quantitative flow cytometry.
Model in which cholesterol passes through the interface between the MLD and CTD as part of the cholesterol transport process.
We sought additional hints to the mechanism of NPC1 cholesterol transport using molecular dynamics simulations.
NPC1 mutant in which the MLD and CTD are locked together showed a similar range of motion for protein backbone atoms to that of wild type.
Long-range concerted motion between protein domains between highly correlated motion and uncorrelated motion .
Protein propagate through the entire protein, affecting long-range domain motion, and these mechanisms are likely employed during sterol transfer.
NPC1L1 mutants that were constrained at their cytoplasmic loop or restricted in terms of the mobility of the MLD in relation to the CTD were designed in a manner analogous to the NPC1 mutants.
NPC1L1 missing its N-terminal domain also failed to import cholesterol efficiently, although a low level of uptake was observed.
NPC1's MLD binds NPC2 to facilitate transfer of cholesterol from NPC2 onto NPC1's N-terminal domain .
We established a binding assay using purified, soluble NPC1L1 N-terminal domain for cholesterol binding .
NPC1L1 N-terminal domain bound cholesterol when it was presented in the presence of sub-CMC NP-40 .
Binding of cholesterol in the form of a bile salt micelle to the MLD was not altered by addition of up to 100 mM of the NPC1L1 inhibitor, ezetimibe, which relies on MLD residues for highaffinity binding .
Ezetimibe binding to wild type NPC1L1 is specific and can be competed away by addition of excess unlabeled ezatimibe.
NPC1L1 N-terminal domain sequences are also important for ezetimibe binding.
We tested the possibility that inter-domain interface residues create a binding site for ezetimibe on NPC1L1.
Ezetimibe blocks NPC1L1 by locking the various domains together, potentially plugging a potential cholesterol channel through the molecule .
Dynamic, inter-domain interactions within NPC1 and NPC1L1 are essential for the ability of these proteins to mediate cholesterol transport out of lysosomes or across the plasma membrane.
Ezetimibe binds NPC1L1 domains and depends on sequences that contribute to domain interface interactions in the protein structure.

NPC2 transfers bound cholesterol to the N-terminal domain of NPC1.
R1002E samples compared with A179K determined by unpaired t test.
Transfer cholesterol from the N-terminal domain to other parts of the protein and/or across the membrane .
We propose a model in which cholesterol can pass directly through NPC1, either to the sterol-sensing domain or all the way through the membrane bilayer.
 PTCH has 12 transmembrane domains instead of 13; it also lacks the cholesterol binding N-terminal domain of NPC1 and NPC1L1.
Stereol-like ligand densities in the transmembrane domain of PTCH molecule, one in the sterol-sensing domain, and a tunnel in the PTCH protein through which a sterol could pass.
NPC1 and NPC1L1 undergo significant conformational transitions to accomplish transport of cholesterol across the membrane.

A recent review on the existing barriers to ABCDE bundle implementation in adult ICU identified four distinct domains: patient-related, clinician- related, protocol-related.
Bedside providers may have concerns about patient safety and may think that the risk it poses outweighs potential benefits. With effective education on the safety and feasibility of bundle implementation, providers can feel empowered and motivated to lead bundle reliability performance.
Resource limitations are a barrier to protocol implementation, especially the availability of personnel such as physical and respiratory therapists, and equipment.

We carried out an association study of HIV-1-infected mothers recruited in Harare, Zimbabwe.
Homozygous infants for the p-198A and int2-180A variants contained in H1 and H3 haplotypes are 4-fold to 6-fold more likely to be infected by HIV-1.
We cloned DC-SIGNR from placental tissues by RT-PCR from 3 homozygous H1 samples containing both the p-198AA and int2-180AA variants associated with HIV-1 transmission.
Diversity in H1 homozygotes of DC-SIGNR is mostly attributable to the entire deletion of exon 2 or exon 3 or to variations in the length of the neck region of the protein.
A mutation observed in infants with the H1 haplotype modifies exon 3 and potentially modifies splicing events .
Exon 3 skipping happens more frequently in presence of the DC-SIGNR int2-180A variant associated with MTCT of HIV-1.
The DC-SIGNR int2-180A variant is always transmitted with the promoter mutation p-198A .
H1 homozygosity for the haplotype H1 was associated with IU transmission in the unadjusted regression analysis.
A mutation in haplotypes H1 and H3 that reduces DC-SIGNR transcriptional activity in vitro and produces lower level of placental tissues in combination with the int2-180A variant.

A possible receptor for hepatitis B virus in eLife.
Only hepatitis B virus and its satellite hepatitis D virus still wait for the development of an in vitro infection system in cell culture.

HCC cell lines stably expressing NTCP and subsequently infected them with HBV or HDV.
Immunofluorescence staining for HBV and HDV infection in cell lines, suggestive of a successful viral infection.
NTCP is a transmembrane protein, usually located in the lateral surface of hepatocytes, which mediates bile acid transport, and is a good candidate for an HBV receptor.
We need to understand how NTCP interacts with both HBV envelope proteins and with other cellular proteins, especially through the motif embedded in the cell membrane.
The authors can use the NTCP-expressing cell lines as the starting materials to systemically identify other factors and make these cell lines more productive and permissive to HBV infection.
The identification of NTCP as a potential viral receptor for HBV may serve as an important initial step for the development of an HBV infection system to facilitate the HBV research and hepatitis B treatment.

adjusted TB prevalence rates in the adult population in rural and urban areas .
From people 65 years or older, the ratio between over 65's and 15 to 64 years old was 8.4 in sputum positive cases and 5.9 in bacteri confirmed cases.
A large proportion of TB cases may be missed using sputum microscopy.
CXRAY was sensitive in detecting TB cases, as yields of bacteriologically confirmed cases were much higher by CXRAY compared with by symptom screening.
Free CXRAY for elders in Shandong, China, 2010.
A large proportion of bacteriologically confirmed TB cases are missed by the national TB program.
Sputum positive cases out of all TB cases in Shandong have declined from 80.9% in 2005 to 64.6% in 2010 .
TB prevalence rate of bacteriologically confirmed cases has reduced by 80% in the last decade in Shandong, compared with national decline of 45% .
An important role in the reduction of TB prevalence, as found in a study of TB notification rates .
Shandong has the highest prevalence rate of bacteriologically confirmed cases in China .
A survey on the state of the economy in the UK.
CXRAY suggestive bacteriologically negative cases may be smear or culture negative TB cases if they had any TB symptoms.
The survey revealed that over half of the TB patients were 65 years and older in Shandong, while the over 65's were more likely to present with abnormal CXRAY and persistent cough.
The Shandong TB epidemic is similar to the epidemic found in the national survey, i.e., the proportion of patients with symptoms, ratios between urban and rural areas, men and women, are similar.
Short-term migrants may have a potentially higher prevalence of TB than the general population .
We did not conduct any cost effectiveness analysis or the social willingness to pay for such a strategy in similar settings.
The prevalence of bacteriologically confirmed TB in Shandong has reduced substantially over the last decade.

A brief summary of the interview with former US Secretary of State John Kerry.
Transmissibility and severity are the 2 most critical factors that determine the effect of an epidemic.
R0 of greater than 1 indicates the infection has the potential for sustained transmission.
Infection Apdm09 was highly transmissible, but the number of deaths per population was 30 times lower than that seen during the 1968 pandemic.
Towards 250,000 to 500,000 cases of Influenza Apdm09 per year, although estimation methods differ.
SARS-CoV may not have been capable of sustained transmission, especially in the setting of control measures.
MERS-CoV appears to have high severity and low transmissibility, and thus far it has been contained.
Can a respiratory virus that is both transmissible and severe be contained?
A preparedness plan was developed that included a surveillance plan, laboratory testing, and contact tracing guidance.
A hospital outbreak in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, among hospitalized patients only 5 of 53 health care–associated cases had documented presence in the same room as a patient with MERS.
Is the world ready for a respiratory virus with high transmissibility and severity?
An estimated 7.3 billion surgical masks or respirators would be required, and perhaps most important, if vaccine development did not start before the virus was introduced, it is unlikely that a significant number of hospitalizations and deaths could be averted.
It is impossible to know what will happen so early in this novel 2019 coronavirus epidemic.
Is the 2019-nCoV infection severe?
Could be affected by 2019-nCoV.
Learning lessons from previous epidemics/pandemics of respiratory viruses should be carefully considered to better control and mitigate potential consequences.
We have been successful in the past and there is nothing yet to predict that this time it is likely to be worse.

Exhaled breath condensate sampling for virus isolation in upper airway infection.
EBC collection using the RTube™ is not promising.
A simple and effective method for diagnosis of respiratory infections.
Respiratory tract infections in healthy adults can be caused by a variety of pathogens and the detection of these agents is currently based on their isolation .
A new sampling method for the screening of respiratory viruses .
 bronchiole fluid film burst during inhalation .
The EBC collection method is suited for the efficient condensation of aerosolised virus particles during normal breathing and to explore the isolation of respiratory viruses in the condensate.
EBCs collected from otherwise healthy volunteers showing respiratory or flu-like symptoms using a commercially available condenser .
A first part of the study that started during the winter and spring of 2008/2009, 70 EBC samples were collected from patients who voluntary presented themselves to our laboratory.
Condensates collected with the RTube™ connected to the ECoVent .
A short questionnaire was used to document the date of birth, the severity of respiratory complaints and to record the days of symptomatic illness from all volunteers.

Infection of the nose with runny or stuffy nose and sneezing events .
We collected EBCs from patients that presented themselves to their general practitioner and screened them for respiratory viruses.
RV, InfA and HRSV-B.
InfB infection detected in the NS and analysis of the EBC demonstrated an InfB infection.
Quantification of exhaled InfB using the RTube™ in combination with the EcoVent.
Collection of exhaled breath condensates is a novel and non-invasive method for obtaining samples of the upper respiratory tract.
The RTube™ collection device collects aerosolized particles of the airway lining fluid which serves as an immediate starting point for molecular testing.
EBC as a specimen for the detection of respiratory viruses .
Exhalation of InfA and -B, PIV1-3, HRSV and HMPV while we have screened the samples for a panel of 14 commonly circulating respiratory viruses.
We started collecting EBCs in parallel with nasal swabs from patients presenting themselves to their medical doctor, 1 to 3 days after onset of symptoms.
EBC positive samples may be explained by different severity of respiratory infection, since comparator samples were of different parts of the respiratory tract.
Six patients that provided positive NS were experiencing symptoms for a longer period at the time of collection .
Fever, headache, watering eyes, stuffed nose, frequent sneezing, sore throat and coughing.
We did not test these samples for other than viral pathogens, we can not exclude the possibility that some of the negative NS are positive for bacteria.
The RTube™ has a better detection rate than the Teflon filter.
The qRT-PCR developed by Lu and coworkers for the detection of RV, did not allow the assessment of the viral load present in the EBC samples .
Age and number of particles produced, the exhaled volume and the age of the patient have an important role for exhalation of viral particles.
InfA in the NS, but not confirmed in the EBC.
We used the RTube™ in combination with the ECoVent, that allowed the registration of additional ventilation parameters such as breathing frequency and exhaled volume.
EBC collected by the RTube™ does not appear to be appropriate for diagnosis of respiratory infections.
EBC collection from patients during respiratory infections may be further investigated for biomarker patterns.
A better identification of the biomarker signature in condensates of individuals experiencing a viral infection might imply interesting findings towards the identification of markers reflecting inflammation or antiviral protection.

Pneumonia remains the leading cause of death in children outside the neonatal period, despite advances in prevention and management.
A strategy to address the residual burden of disease once these have been implemented.
Pneumonia has been the leading cause of death in children younger than 5 years for decades.
The burden of childhood pneumonia has been reduced substantially over the last decade, despite an increase in the global childhood population.
Pneumonia deaths decreased from 1.8 million in 2000 to 900,000 in 2013 .
Pneumonia incidence in high-income countries is estimated at 0.015 episodes per child year.
Pneumonia in low- and middle-income countries .
A meta-analysis of long-term outcomes after childhood pneumonia categorized chronic respiratory sequelae into major and minor groups .
Pneumonia in childhood is a major cause of mortality and morbidity across the life course.
 Chest radiologic changes have been considered the gold standard for defining pneumonia event because clinical findings can be subjective and clinical definitions of pneumonia can be nonspecific.
Small areas of atelectasis in children can be difficult to distinguish from primary end-point pneumonia .
Widespread use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugated vaccination has decreased the incidence of radiologic pneumonia.
The Philippines has the highest unemployment rate in the world .
The World Health Organization (WHO) radiologic case definition was not intended to distinguish bacterial from viral etiology but rather to define a sub-set of pneumonia cases in which pneumococcal infection was considered more likely.
A revised case definition of primary end-point pneumonia for detecting the burden of pneumonia prevented by pneumococcal conjugate vaccination .
P pneumococcal conjugate vaccination decreases the incidence of radiologic pneumonia.

We use a designated hand-washing sink lab gallery to model dispersion of GFP-expressing Escherichia coli from sink wastewater to the surrounding environment.
A GFP-expressing E. coli-containing putative biofilm extended upward over 7 days to reach the strainer, resulting in droplet dispersion rather than dispersion directly from the P-trap.
A staged mode of transmission involving biofilm growth from the lower pipe to the sink strainer and subsequent splatter to the bowl and surrounding area.

GFP-expressing E. coli in the P-trap.
GFP-expressing E. coli found in the tailpipe .
Sink-to-sink transmission of E. coli .
GFP-expressing E. coli was detected in sinks 2 and 3 on day 14.
P-trap water samples collected from the sinks, which were subsequently identified to be Pseudomonas sp. or Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and fluorescent colonies were confirmed to be E. coli.
Dispersion of microspheres from sinks.
When the sink bowl was coated with microspheres, polyester sheets overlaid on the counter space captured the dispersedmicrospheres caused by the faucet operation.
No fluorescent CFU was detected when GFPexpressing E. coli was inoculated into the offset drain tailpiece only 4 in. below the strainer.
Dispersion pattern recorded when the sink bowl was coated with GFPexpressing E. coli .
Dispersion of GFP-expressing E. coli caused by the faucet operation was much more extensive when the strainer was allowed to be colonized with GFP Expressions.
Smaller dispersion along the minor axis of the sink bowl is associated with shorter distance from the strike point of the faucet water to the bowl along this axis.
No GFP-expressing E. coli CFU recorded on plates placed beyond 30 in. from the strainer, demarcating the range of dispersion under these experimental conditions.
In this paper, the word dispersion is used as a synonym for dispersion, and the term dispersion itself is used to describe dispersion.
E. coli originate from the P-trap via droplet creation when the water from the faucet hits the sink bowl and the surrounding area.

Rapid polymerase chain reaction testing for influenza in emergency departments is associated with better patient and laboratory outcomes than standard multiplex PCR testing.
Fewer patients tested by rapid PCR were admitted to hospital and more received their test results before leaving the ED .
Evaluating the impact of treating patients for influenza virus and RSV in the emergency department.
Multiplex PCR can detect numerous respiratory viruses, including influenza and parainfluenza viruses, RSV, adenovirus, rhinovirus and coronavirus with very high sensitivity and specificity.
Rapid, easy-to-use PCR-based respiratory virus diagnostic tests.
Before-and-after study in four metropolitan public hospital EDs in Sydney, NSW: three general hospitals and one children's hospital .
We analysed data for all patients tested for influenza virus or RSV.
The proportion of patients admitted to hospital was lower in the rapid PCR group for both children under 18 and patients over 60 years old .
 Rapid PCR testing of ED patients for influenza virus and RSV was associated with better outcomes on a range of indicators, suggesting benefits for patients and the health care system.
Rapid polymerase chain reaction testing for influenza and respiratory syncytial viruses was introduced in New South Wales in July 2017.
Rapid PCR testing is associated with significantly fewer hospital admissions, more rapid test turnaround, and patients receiving test results before leaving the ED.
Rapid PCR testing of ED patients for major respiratory viruses can benefit patients and reduce resource use.
Linking laboratory data by linking the ED and laboratory information system datasets.
The primary outcomes were admission to hospital, ED length of stay , test turnaround time, and the patient receiving their test result before leaving the ED.
Analyses of binary outcomes and quantile regression analyses of continuous outcomes .
Sensitivity analyses limited to data for children or older patients.
We analysed data for 3741 patients presenting to the four EDs during two periods: 1491 consecutive patients and 2250 during July-December 2017 .
A comparison of rapid and standard PCR groups for microbiology tests .
Biochemistry/haematology and microbiology tests comprised 71.1% of the 22 876 other tests ordered for patients in the study.
ED LOS was similar for the standard PCR and rapid PCR groups in both age-based subgroups .
Rapid PCR testing of ED patients for major respiratory viruses is associated with significantly fewer admissions to hospital, more rapid delivery of test results, more patients receiving their test results before leaving the ED, and less frequent ordering.
Early diagnosis of respiratory infections is associated with significantly fewer hospitalisations of influenza-positive patients.
Rapid diagnostic tests for respiratory viruses have also been associated with lower hospital admission rates.
Rapid influenza virus testing can improve hospital bed management and outbreak prevention.
Rapid PCR methods do not reduce ED LOS.
A Cochrane review based on three randomised controlled trials did not find a statistically significant association of rapid viral diagnosis with lower mean ED LOS.
We found that ordering of some microbiology tests, including blood culture, sputum culture, and respiratory bacterial and virus serology, is significantly less frequent for patients tested by rapid PCR.
When point-of-care testing was used.
A higher rate of positive results for patients tested by rapid PCR than for standard PCR may reflect a higher prevalence of influenza during 2017 than in 2016.
We could not fully account for all potential confounding variables, nor for temporal trends and other unmeasured factors, such as changes in clinician testing practices.
We attempted to reduce seasonal effects by selecting similar time frames for the two study periods, to reduce selection bias by including all ED patients tested for influenza virus and RSV.
The cost-benefit balance of rapid testing was not evaluated because relevant data were not available.
Rapid PCR testing for influenza virus and RSV infections in patients attending EDs was associated with significant improvements in a range of patient and laboratory outcomes, suggesting potential benefits for both patients and the health care system.

Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus with codon usage bias.
 ORF1 and ORF2 are independent among the evolution of RHDV.
Codon usage bias among viruses is accounted by mutational pressure and translational selection.
Codon usage is related to mutational pressure, G +C content, the segmented nature of the genome and the route of transmission of the virus .
Codon usage in Epstein-Barr virus regulates latent versus productive infection .
Codon usage analysis of Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus .
RHDV: A self-coding 3C-like cysteinase .
Codon usage bias in RHDV is a factor reducing the expression of VP10 and the evolution of the ORFs.
A random sample of RHDV sequences obtained from GenBank .
RSCU values of each codon in a ORF of RHDV were calculated according to previous reports.
The codons with RSCU value higher than 1.0 have positive codon usage bias.
The index GC3s means the fraction of the nucleotides G+C at the synonymous third codon position, excluding Met, Trp, and the termination codons.
The ENC, as the best estimator of absolute synonymous codon usage bias, was calculated for the quantification of the codonusage bias of each ORF .
S represents the given 3 % value of ENC .

ENC-plots of ORFs constrained only by a C 3 +G 3 composition will lie on or just below the curve of the predicted values .
Bias, bias, bias: the state of the art on bias.
In this paper, I propose a new term for VP10, and it's called VP10.
Figure 2. Effective number of codons used in each ORF plotted against the GC3s.
VP10 plays an important role in the certain stage of whole RHDV lifecycle.
No correlation existed in ENC values of two ORFs, indicating that codon usage patterns and evolution of twoORFs are separated each other.
We found that relatively isolated spots from ORF2 tend to cluster into two groups: the ordinate value of one group is positive value and the other one is negative value.
Codon usage bias in RHDV with high codon bias is nearly contrary between ORF1 and ORF2, which maybe one of factors regulating the expression of VP60 and VP10.
VP10 played an important role in RHDV lifecycle, according to the principal component analysis for ORF2 of RSCU.

Obesity is one of the risk factors underlying frequent RTIs in the German adult population.
Obesity is associated with a consistently higher frequency of upper and lower RTIs and predominantly falls in the upper 10% group.
Interaction with sports activity and dietary patterns: a case study in the United States.
Frequent and severe respiratory tract infections are an important morbidity factor in our society and a considerable cost burden in terms of medical treatment.

Recruitment for the AWIS study and the present sub-cohort.
An analysis of the association between obesity and RTIs .
We counted different infection symptoms as separate episodes for the outcome indicator "≥3 long lasting infections", even if they overlapped in time.
The diary RTI score was expanded to a score at the seasonal level by averaging over the six months of each season.
Further variables considered in the study were age, gender, self-reported weight and height for BMI calculation, educational level, contact with children, comorbidities, smoking status, sports activity and dietary intake patterns.
A generalised linear model with identity link and binomial type variance for RTI symptoms.
We determined the monthly frequency of long-lasting infections by pooling the data over all seasons.
A logistic regression model with random intercept applied to the individual data for each month taking the 18 months as a categorical covariate into account.
Obesity-RTI association with age groups and education as simultaneous categorical covariates.
Effect modification by a binary variable was assessed by fitting an overall model with the corresponding interactions parametrized so we could directly read off the two subgroup-specific ORs.
The study population consisted of 1455 individuals with a median age of 51.08 years.
Towards the end of the year, the UK government announced plans to introduce a number of measures to improve the UK economy, including measures to reduce the number of redundancies.
Missing items in the returned diaries were limited and ranged from 1.2% for rhinitis and pharyngitis/laryngritis to 2.6% for other acute respiratory infections.
Pneumonia, bronchitis, and long-lasting RTIs .
Overweight and obese people consistently have a higher prevalence of single RTIs, URTIs, LRTIs and other outcome parameters.
Obesity is more associated with long lasting infections than the individual symptoms .
The association between obesity and RTI outcomes was more prominent for women than for men and reached statistical significance only for the former .
A small group of people with obesity and higher sports activity presented rather similar patterns.
Obesity is associated with RTIs and could be an emerging risk factor for RTIs.
Obesity increases the risk of influenza-like illness, bronchitis and pneumonia .
We generated a diary score summing-up all ten symptoms and allowing to average per month, per whole season or over the whole period of three years.
Seasonal risk for recurrent and severe RTIs is more pronounced than those of the three-year score.
The association between obesity and RTIs remained nearly unchanged after adjustment for age, gender, educational status, contact to children, smoking status and nutrition scores.
Obesity and RTI burden are due to physiological differences in the immune responsiveness between obese and non-obese individuals rather than lifestyle differences.
Gender-dependent effects of obesity on the immune system .
Obese women have fewer NK cells for clearing virus-infected cells than men .
Excessive oxidative stress induced by vigorous aerobic as well as anaerobic sports activity is exacerbated in people with obesity, but not in normal weight individuals.
Obese people who eat a healthier diet are more likely to develop infections.
Dietary habits among obese individuals with RTIs may explain the puzzle.

PLOS Medicine Editors propose ideal qualities for the World Health Organization's next Director General.
Reformation of WHO to ready it to lead responses to future health emergencies .
The process for choosing WHO's next leader has begun, promising to be protracted and rigorous as befits the importance of the role.
The World Health Organization should be replaced with new, more appropriate organizations, free of cumbersome, archaic obligations and entitlements, writes Lorenz Von Seidlein.
WHO needs a bold reform agenda to fix long-standing problems recognized by every independent group that has evaluated the Organization.
The World Health Organization's regional and country offices are seen by some as unaccountable, yet the agency of the future will need to be connected and responsive to the resources and needs of all constituent countries.
WHO's next director-general should be a proven leader and advocate, perhaps from a lowincome or middle-income country, and featuring prominently are the constraints imposed by WHO's current funding mechanisms.
The World Health Organization (WHO) needs to be an independent agency with the intelligence, agility, and operational capacity to tackle the coming global health challenges.
The World Health Organization (WHO) is facing a new era of health problems that only an organization with global reach can hope to meet.

A case control study and a cohort study among vendors at a farmers' market.
The case control study identified close proximity to and stopping for at least a few seconds at the sheep's pen as significant risk factors for disease.
A large outbreak of C. burnetii in a pregnant ewe that had lambed as well as 25% of its herd tested positive.
Q fever is a worldwide zoonosis caused by Coxiella burnetii, a small, gram-negative obligate intracellular bacterium.
C. burnetii is able to survive in a spore-like state for months to years, outbreaks among humans have also occurred through contaminated dust carried by wind.
Acute C. burnetii fever is a self-limited febrile illness associated with severe headache.
Q fever is a non-specific form of endocarditis .
In Germany, acute Q fever is a notifiable disease.
An outbreak of Q fever at a spa town near Soest in Belgium.
An outbreak investigation team was formed and included public health professionals from the local health department, the state health department and the Robert Koch-Institute .
We conducted exploratory interviews with patients in Soest hospitalized due to atypical pneumonia.
Atypical pneumonia infection with Coxiella burnetii antigens in acute and convalescent sera.
We alerted internists and gynaecologists through the journal of the German Medical Association and asked them to send serum samples to the NCL if they identified patients from these risk groups who had been at the farmers' market during the outbreak.
A case control study on the farmers' market and Q fever in Soest.
Exclusion criterion was negative IgM-titer against phase II antigens.
We calculated the attributable fraction of cases exposed to the farmers' market on May 4 as /OR and all cases due to this exposure as/OR.
A possible link to the farmers' market in Soest for Q-fever.
An independent estimate of the proportion of hospitalizations among symptomatic patients beyond that reported through the statutory surveillance system.
We used the same case definition as in CCS1, but included only persons that had visited the farmers' market on May 4, the second day of the market.
An estimate of the attack rate among visitors to the market .
We investigated whether the distance of vendor stands from the sheep pen or dispersion of C. burnetii by wind were relevant risk factors for acquiring Q fever.
A list of symptoms, all of which can be treated in the same way.
The relative distance of the stands to the sheep pen was estimated by counting the stands between the pen and the stand in question.
Wind direction and location of the stands in reference to the sheep pen .
We identified a small cohort of 9 sailor friends who visited the farmers' market on May 4, 2003.

Cardiological patients with valvular heart defects and pregnant women with chronic Q fever infection .
We recruited 20 cases and 36 controls who visited the farmers' market on May 4 for the second case control study.
Self-reported proximity to or time spent with/close to the sheep was not associated with a shorter incubation period.
7 vendors who worked within two stand units of the sheep pen, 6 became cases compared to only 7 of 70 persons who worked in a stand at a greater distance.
In the section of the market facing the wind coming from the pen , 4 of 44 vendors became cases.
A flock of ewes that gave birth to twin lambs at 6:30 a.m. on May 4, 2003 tested positive for C. burnetii.
The number of sheep that tested positive for E.coli in a sheep flock in the region ranged from 8% to 24% .
We have described one of the largest Q fever outbreaks in Germany which, due to its point-source nature, provided the opportunity to assess many epidemiological features of the disease that can be rarely studied otherwise.
A large outbreak of Q fever in Jena, Germany, linked to the abortion of an infected cow at a farmers' market .
The first case control study served to confirm the hypothesis of an association between the outbreak and the farmers' market.
The point-source nature of the outbreak permitted calculation of the incubation period of cases which averaged 21 days and ranged from 2 to 48 days.
Early onset of Q fever in two cases with attack rates and 95% confidence intervals .
The second case control study among persons who visited the market on May 4 demonstrated that both close proximity to the ewe and duration of exposure were important risk factors for Q fever.
A small number of cases of sheep being killed by a gust of wind were caused by the weather station.
The proportion of clinical cases hospitalized for Q fever was 25%, similar to the proportion found in persons pooled from the other studies.
Reporting bias is an unlikely explanation for the relatively high proportion of cases hospitalized in this outbreak.
A study on the attack rate among adults visiting the market on the second day.
Infection of pregnant ewe -upon lambing -was comparable to that of entire herds, albeit in different settings.
Children are more likely than adults to develop symptomatic illness.

The steps of calculating HeteSim scores between two kinds of objects can be presented as follows:
We can split the path into two parts when the length n of path is even.
Splitting the path into two equallength paths if n is odd, we need to deal with such problem.

Sensitivity of influenza testing in Canada based on results of a national respiratory virus surveillance system.
The sensitivity of influenza tests reported to this national laboratory surveillance system is considerably less than reported test characteristics for most laboratory tests.
Clinicians do not routinely seek laboratory confirmation of clinical illness for several reasons: diagnosis will often not alter patient management, a paucity of real-time, accurate, inexpensive testing methods and because influenza is not recognized as the etiology.
The performance characteristics of currently available tests for influenza are sub-optimal .
Samples collected from patients are not always indicative of their illness .
 weekly respiratory virus identifications from September 1999 to August 2006 .
Influenza A positive tests in all age groups and sporadic cases.
A survey of laboratory techniques in current use for the 2005/06 season .
The weekly number of tests negative for influenza was modelled, using Poisson regression, as a function of viral identifications for influenza, RSV, adenovirus and PIV as well as a baseline consisting of seasonality, trend and holiday variables.
The Poisson regression model with a linear link function was estimated using SAS PROC GENMOD: Coefficients b 5 to b 9 are multipliers.
On the sensitivity of influenza A positive specimens to additional tests.
Sensitivity was calculated as the number of influenza positive tests divided by the model-estimated number of false negative tests, or equivalently the estimates of sensitivity for influenza A and B are given by 1/ and 1/ respectively.
On average b 7 tests were performed for RSV and found to be negative for influenza.
Sequential testing for influenza and other respiratory viruses .
An estimate of sensitivity applicable to test results reported to RVDSS, though significant use of rapid antigen tests would reduce the overall sensitivity.
No virus was identified in 75% of specimens submitted for testing .
False negative results contributed to the large number of negative tests during periods of influenza activity.
Estimated sensitivity of influenza A testing for the 1999/2000-2005/06 period.
A model fit of laboratory testing procedures during the SARS period.
Weekly influenza negative tests exceeded the expected number, or equivalently, a period of successive positive residuals.
Exclusion of these data points did not alter the sensitivity estimate for influenza.
The attribution of influenza negative test results to influenza and other viruses is illustrated in Figure 3 .
Fluenza was confirmed in only 14% of specimens sent for testing over the winter period, whereas the sensitivity estimate would imply that up to 40% of influenza tests could be attributed to an influenza infection.
An influenza infection could be model-attributed to an influenza infection annually.
The number of influenza positive tests in the off-season was almost negligible; suggesting that the false positive rate applicable to RVDSS influenza testing is minimal.
The model estimated sensitivity based on influenza test results of 30-40% is much lower than the standard assay sensitivities documented in the literature.
From a variety of clinical settings and processed with a range of procedures across the country.
A large number of respiratory pathogens are not routinely tested for, or reported to the RVDSS.
False negative results are more likely to bias the sensitivity of the system than synchronous activity.
For care due to a secondary bacterial infection, the model would statistically attribute a negative test in this case to the primary infection; one of the four RVDSS viruses or to the seasonal baseline.
Standardization of sample procurement, testing and reporting procedures would likely reduce the overall false negative rate.
A delay in specimen procurement for RT-PCR and culture procedures .
RVDSS is a complex system, and the use of RT-PCR testing can improve accuracy.
System level sensitivity estimates that include the effects of sample quality are limited.
A model estimate of 30% of influenza tests that were due to influenza infections appears plausible.
We were unable to estimate the extent of co-infection in the RVDSS data.

Alignment of the KEN domains in RNaseL and IRE1.
RNaseL can degrade single-stranded RNA irrespective of its origin although there seems to exist a bias towards cleavage of viral RNA.
An evolution towards insulating gene expression from RNaseL activity .
RNaseL reduces functional ribosomes and ribosomal protein mRNA .
A pharmacological agent extends the physiological role of this pathway beyond the boundary of being only an anti-viral mechanism.
UPR encompasses a networked transcriptional and translational gene-expression program, initiated by three ER-membrane resident sensors.
IRE1 is a type I single-pass trans-membrane protein in which, similar to what is observed with RNaseL, the N-terminal resident in the ER lumen serves as sensor and the cytosolic C-Terminal as the effector.
The absence of unfolded proteins and the "presence" of HSPA5 molecules bound to a membrane-proximal disordered segment of the protein in the ER-lumen-resident Nterminus .
Exogenous over-expression of IRE1 in mammalian cells lead to activation suggesting that, under homeostatic conditions, the non-juxtaposition of cytosolic domains maintains an inactive IRE2.
RIDD pathway down-regulates the level of microRNA precursors and can potentially cleave in the anticodon loop of tRNA Phe .
The IRE1 RNase domain cleaves the Xbp1u mRNA transcript at two precise internal positions within the open reading frame generating three segments, the terminal two of which are ligated by a tRNA ligase in yeast and by an unknownligase in mammalian cells, to produce the X
XBP1S trans-activates genes encoding multiple chaperones and ERAD pathway genes whereas RIDD reduces flux of polypeptides entering the ER lumen .
In chronic UPR such transcripts are rendered susceptible to degradation promoting apoptosis induction .
Infection of mammalian cells by a multitude of viruses induce an UPR which is sometimes characterized by suppression of signaling by one or more of the three sensor.
IRE1 activation during bacterial infection, has been shown to activate RIG-I signaling .
IRE1 cleaves virus-derived RNAs in association with ER-membrane .
IRE1 activation increases viral titre, inhibiting the RNase activity of activated IRE1 has the opposite effect .
RIDD-resistant mRNAs that encode ER-transitory but are not ER-essential proteins can confer protection from IRE1 cleavage .
Virus RNA to RIDD cleavage .
RIDD cleaves Xbp1u and other mRNAs in addition to microRNA precursors.
IRE1 cleaves pre-dominantly in single-stranded region .
IRE1 would have preferential distribution in the rough ER which, upon activation, would give it ready access to mRNAs for initiating the RIDD pathway.
A protein pathway leading from both these proteins has the potential to lead to cell death.

Different BtCoV/Rh/YN2012 ORF4a share <64.4% amino acid identity, all of them could activate IFN-β.
The weak infectivity of RsYN1 pseudotyped retrovirus in Huh-7 cells could be explained by the binding of spike protein to polysaccharide secreted to the surface.

The antiviral properties of TFO-transfected cells are associated with specific binding of circular TFOs towards targeted regions.
TFO1 shows antiviral properties in cell-free systems.
Inefficiency of the transfection reagent to transfect the TFO into CRFK cells .
The antiviral properties, as demonstrated by the circular TFOs, were probably associated with the binding of the TFO to the target region, based on both the Watson-Crick and Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds, which enhance the stability in terms of enthalpy.
Pyrimidine bases can only form one additional hydrogen bond with incoming third bases .
SiRNA with antiviral activity against FIPV 79-1146 .
In this study, we demonstrated short circular TFO RNAs between 28 and 34 mers, which are able to inhibit FIPV replication by binding to specific target regions of the FipV genome.
The inability of TFO2 to show antiviral effect due to failure in the formation of functional tertiary structure of the triplex formation cannot be ruled out.
The circular TFO RNA has the potential to be developed as a therapy against FIPV in cats.

In-vitro co-infection with Influenza virus A/H1N1 and Streptococcus pneumoniae synergistically increases protein-10 expression compared to singly-infected cells conditions.
Viral and bacterial co-infection modulates the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and leads to exacerbated IP-10 expression, which could play a major role in the pathogenesis of pneumonia.

This study provides additional in vitro and clinical data on the immunopathology of mixed viral and bacterial pneumonia .
Mixed infection synergistically induced release of the pro-inflammatory chemokine IP-10, strongly suggesting human blood leukocytes contribute to the immunopathology of pneumonia.
Turn targets and downregulates the JAK-STAT regulator SOCS-6 and consequently increases CXCL10 expression.
A signaling pathway occur to control host innate inflammatory response against viral and/or bacterial infections.
High diversity of viral and bacterial associations in biological samples from children with pneumonia.

The BAC constructs pBeloR26 and pBelaR26_E2gif were analysed for genetic stability of the cDNA to determine the suitability of the BAC vector for maintaining full-length pestivirus cDNAs.
Viruses rescued from BAC constructs are tested for genetic stability within mammalian cells.
Nt position 10665 in vR26/P-12 is reverted from A to G as in the parental cDNA.
Passage of rescued vR26_E2gif chimeric virus in PK15 cells resulted in rapidly decreasing virus titres and was discontinued after the 2nd passage . Instead, further passage of this chimic virus was performed in ovine SFT-R cells and resulted in much higher titers
Better than the vR26_E2gif chimeric virus .
To check that the viruses retained their antibody reaction properties after these passages, cells were infected with viruses from the 12th SFT-R cell culture passage and stained with polyclonal anti-pestivirus serum and with specific mAbs directed against the CSFV-E2 and BDV
The 4th passage of vR26 displayed a slower growth rate than the virus obtained after 12 passages .
We established the first BAC containing the full-length cDNA of a CSFV vaccine strain.
Red/ET mediated BAC recombination of CSFV full-length cDNA can be used to correct mutations in the E2 protein.
Red/ET recombination-mediated mutagenesis of pestivirus BAC cDNAs provides a useful tool for advancing the construction of modified pestiviruses.
Two new chimeric pestiviruses containing E2 sequences can be efficiently discriminated from the vR26 using specific anti-E2 monoclonal antibodies.
The pBeloR26 cDNA is stable during extensive propagation in E. coli.
Extensive passaging of the rescued vR26 and the chimeric virus derivative resulted in a change at nucleotide position A10665G (resulting in the predicted aa).

A population-based cross-sectional multilevel study to examine whether a relationship exists between operation volumes and SSIs.
A study of CABG operation volumes and SSIs.
The current study takes CABG SSIs as an example to examine whether a relationship exists between operation volumes and SSIs, given different SSI cases identification, operation volume definitions and categorization methods.
A multilevel study of provider volumes and SSIs after adjusting for patient-, surgeon-, and hospital-level covariates.
We used data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database from 2005 and 2008.
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National Taiwan University Hospital .
In this study, we adopted the ICD-9-CM SSI codes and the Classification and Regression Trees model, which was developed in our previous work to identify SSI cases.
Identification of SSIs by the ICD-9-CM based model.
Cases based on surveillance were identified if the patient met the Taiwan CDC's criteria, which are the same as those adopted in the U.S.
The classification algorithms, the multivariable regression model, and the data mining model were adopted to develop alternative models based on surrogate indicators to identify cases of CABG SSIs and to compare the performance among these models and the ICD-9-CMbased model.

A study on CABG surgery and SSIs in Taiwan.
We used the following two definitions to define operation volumes: the cumulative operation volumes by each surgeon and hospital within the study period, which was the most common definition in the literature.
This study categorized surgeon and hospital volumes into low, medium, and high volume groups by quartile method and kmeans clustering algorithm.
In the quartile method, the cut-off value of the first quartile for hospital volumes was 5.65, and the third quartile was 6.43.

Model 3 shows that the association did not exist between hospital's/ surgeon's volumes and SSIs.
High-volume surgeons are more likely to have SSIs than low-volume ones.
Mixed-effect models in which the SSIs were identified by the CART model, and the operation volumes were also defined as the cumulative volume in previous one year for each surgery.
We examined the associations of surgeon and hospital volumes with SSIs in stratification analyses by underlying diseases.
In terms of hospital operation volumes, the association did not exist.
The relationships between hospital volumes and SSIs did not exist, no matter which definitions, categorization mehods, or SSIs case identification approaches were used.
Surgeon volumes and SSIs were not robust in our data, and also by different SSI cases identification approaches.
Is provider volume the only one predictor for outcome of care?
Service/ operation volumes are treated as a proxy indicator for experiences; previous studies used it to examine whether practice makes perfect or not.
We used the cumulative operation volumes within the study period as the definition, and identified SSIs by ICD-9-CM codes.
The level of SSIs control in hospitals, leading to different findings in this study.

We provide a publicly available planning tool which is reproducible by an explicitly formulated structure and designed to operate with the optimal combination of precision, realism and generality.
InfluSim is an online available software which efficiently assists public health planners in designing optimal interventions against pandemic influenza.
Infection simulations like complex computer simulations while offering the same time reproducibility, higher computational performance and better operability.
Preparedness against pandemic influenza using computer simulations .
Incorporate realistic intervention strategies which can be generalized into recommendations, but are sufficiently realistic to satisfy public health requirements.
A dynamic modelling structure for pandemic influenza planning .
A dynamic system for influenza pandemic preparedness planning.
The model is based on a system of 1,081 differential equations which extend the classic SEIR model.
This paper presents a computer model that can be programmed in Java, and further information can be downloaded from the online supporting material.
The German National Pandemic Preparedness Plan is based on a contact matrix which yields a given basic reproduction number R0.
R0 = 2.5 which means that cases infect on average2.5 individuals if everybody is susceptible and if no interventions are performed.
A partitioning of the cases into four categories allows combining the realistic description of the transmission dynamics with an easy calculation of the resources consumed during an outbreak.
A model of the incubation and contagious period .
Home until their disease is over, hospital until it is over .
We provide some examples of model output of InfluSim, version 2.0, by means of four sensitivity analyses.
A pandemic wave in a town of 100,000 inhabitants .
The shape of the curves depends on the course of contagiousness: the pandemic wave proceeds relative slowly if the contagiousness does not change during the infectious period .
 InfluSim describes a pandemic wave within a homogeneously mixing population like a town or city, but surprisingly produces the same dynamics as individual-based simulations.
A deterministic model like InfluSim cannot reliably represent effects originating from stochasticity, from effects in small populations, or from heterogeneities.
Change the course of an epidemic compared to the deterministic prediction .
A Bayesian approach to Bayesian risk estimation .
Time-dependent solutions of InfluSim allow assessing peak values of the relevant variables such as outpatients, hospitalizations and deaths.
We propose a novel compartmentalized model of infectious disease in which individuals transmit infection before onset of symptoms, and some cases may remain asymptomatic, but still infecting others.
InfluSim is a free, open-source, and bug-free program for health planning.
Who-acquires-infection-from-whom matrix shows the frequency of contacts between different age classes.
Distribution of sojourn times and health requirements of the software.
Infected individuals are infected at a rate λ a which depends on their age a and on time t.
The last l incubation stages are regarded as early infectious period during which patients may already spread the infection .
We use the contagious stages to measure time since onset and allow for treatment up to stage m a.
Contagiousness of asymptomatic cases in the early infectious period and equality of the contagiousness of moderately and severely sick cases: assumed.
Hospitalizations per severe case: hospitalizations persevere case: ; case fatality of hospitalized, but untreated patients calculated from .
Antiviral treatment reduces the patients' contagiousness and it reduces hospitalization and death by f H percent.
Convalescence is modelled in j stages so that progression from one stage to the next occurs at rate j/D C .
C: Cumulative number of deaths for values of x 50 as in C.
We employ a whoacquires-infection-from whom matrix which gives the relative frequency of contacts of infective individuals of age a i with other people of Age a s .
A matrix of crude contact rates for the first time.
In the absence of interventions, we have to multiply these contact rates with the contagiousness factors b L , b A , b M and b V to obtain the effective contact rates:
Infection in the early infectious period, of asymptomatic cases, of moderately sick cases.
Children's contact rate to adults increases by a factor F HC .
Contacts between very sick children and other children in a higher or lower age class remain unchanged: .
Closing day care centres and schools at time t will not necessarily prevent all the contacts that would have happened with other children.
Children's contact with susceptible adults increases by the "child care factor" F CC .
Child care at home increases the exposure of healthy children to contagious adults :
Cancelling mass gathering events at time t reduces contacts by a fraction r mass .
Mass gathering events are possible or closed: where 1 mass is a function which indicates when mass gathering event is possible or when they are closed:
The general population may effectively reduce contacts which can be a result of wearing facial masks, increasing "social distance", adopting improved measures of "respiratory hygiene" or simply of a general change in behaviour.
Mass gathering event is forbidden while m mass gathering events are allowed.
Contact rates in the late incubation period and that of asymptomatic cases remain unchanged:
Infected individuals in the late incubation period, for asymptomatic cases.
We multiply each contact rate with a weighting factor whereby k is the stage of contagiousness.
Asymptomatic cases in For x = 1, contagiousness is equally high in all stages; for x = 0, only the first stage is contagious.
The next generation matrix has the following elements where is the fraction of untreated extremely severe cases who die from the disease .
In this paper, we look at the role of the media, and how they can be used to improve the lives of people.
Using user-specified numbers of people N a in the age classes and the fractions F a of people under high risk within each age class , we obtain the initial population sizes according to age and risk class.

We analyzed the diagnostic accuracy of biomarkers in suspected CAP adults visiting emergency departments for whom CAP diagnosis was established by a systematic multidetector thoracic CT scan.

A false CAP diagnosis in many patients: among CAP suspected patients with radiological pulmonary infiltrate, one-third had pulmonary infiltrate on thoracic CT-scan.

Approval of CAP diagnosis using 4-level Likert scale and follow-up data.
Blood samples were collected at inclusion in sodium heparin-treated tubes, centrifuged, and stored at −40°C until completion of the study.
Naso-pharyngeal swabs collected at enrollment and placed in a Middle Virocult MWE transport medium.
The multiplex PCR results were positive for at least one of the 15 respiratory viruses and no bacteria were found using PCR and routine microbiological samples.
Baseline and follow-up characteristics were described by means and standard deviations or by median and interquartile range for continuous variables normally distributed or with skewed distribution.
Predicting definite CAP using CRP and PCT .
Optimal cut-off for CRP and PCT.
A multivariate logistic regression model was built to identify factors associated with having definite CAP as compared to having an excluded CAP diagnosis.
A two-sided, two-tailed, and p-values below 0.05 were considered to denote statistical significance.
Two hundred patients with suspected CAP were included in the present study, for which CRP and PCT assays and nasopharyngeal swab for multiplex PCR were available .
Towards the end of the study, the number of elderly patients was expected to increase, and it did.
Pulmonary infiltrates were seen on chest X-ray in 127 patients; thoracic CT-scan revealed a parenchymal infiltrate in 27 % of the 73 patients without infiltrate.
The Court of Arbitration for Sport in England and Wales has upheld the adjudication of the European Court of Human Rights.
The CRP and PCT distributions in the 200 patients are presented in Fig. 2.
Sensitivity analyses for the combination of CRP and PCT, using these optimal cut-offs, resulted in a PPV of 0.74 and a NPV of0.58.
The present study is novel as patients prospectively benefited from extensive investigation to determine the diagnosis of CAP in the ED, including both early multidetector thoracic scan and day-28 adjudication committee.
The clinical characteristics of the patients included in this sub-study are consistent with those in the current literature.
Identification of respiratory infection in emergency patients suffering from CAP using naso-pharyngeal PCR .
We found that the clinical presentation of excluded CAP patients was similar to that of definite CAP patients.
We cannot establish discriminating values for PCT in CAP-suspected patients, while median values of both biomarkers did increase with level of certainty for CAP diagnosis.
PCT levels remained above threshold both in excluded CAP patients without infectious disorders and in definite CAP presumably related to virus.
The lack of statistically significant differences in the mean CRP and PCT values in definite CAP cases, whether or not these biomarkers were available for the adjudication committee, argues against a major impact of these results on adjudication Committee classification.
CAP alters biomarker performance and reduced the yield of bacterial cultures, although such population reflects the usual emergency department practice.
An X-ray to explore the chest, only invasive local microbiological samples would have provided a diagnosis.
Neither CRP nor PCT cut-off values carried sufficient weight to confirm or refute CAP diagnosis at bedside; this underlines that these biomarkers are telltales of the host inflammatory response.

A prospective study on the attack rate of pH1N1/2009 virus in Reunion Island and risk factors of infection.
Antibodies to pH1N1/2009v were titered using the hemagglutination inhibition inhibition assay.
P pH1N1/2009v infection was three times that estimated from clinical surveillance, indicating that almost two thirds of infections occurring at the community level have escaped medical detection.
The potential impact of this first third-millenium influenza pandemic has been revisited downwards as morbidity and case-fatality rates were less severe than initially.
Serological surveys can overcome this limitation, but must take into account a significant proportion of the population that exhibited crossprotective antibody titers before circulation of the pH1N1/2009v .

A prospective population-based study investigating herd immunity induced by the 2009 pandemic influenza virus and identifying risk factors for pH1N1/2009v infection .
A non-inactivated viral antigen with nondenatured epitopes can be used to detect cross-reacting antibodies.
P pH1N1/2009 influenza: antibody titers in 93.5% and gave evidence seroconversion in 73.9% of qRT-PCR.
We considered that titers of .1/40, in sera collected during weeks 30 and 31 were cross reactive antibodies and not de novo antibodies triggered by the pandemic virus and hence used them as a proxy for baseline pre epidemic immunity.
The pandemic virus epidemic activity was very low in our study cohort and it became significant only after week 32.
A substantial proportion of Reunion Island's population had pre-existing immunity to 2009 pandemic influenza virus with the highest baseline-proxy seroprevalence rate observed among adults aged of 60 years or more.
A high proportion of sera titering HIA = 1/40 among 122 sera from adult patients sent for diagnostic purposes to the Regional Hospital microbiology laboratory, during the first half of 2009 .

School children have likely played the central role in the epidemic diffusion of the pandemic virus.
P pH1N1/2009 infection in Reunion Island .
A large fraction of those who got infected by pH1N1/2009 virus escaped medical detection, probably because they developed mild disease or asymptomatic infection, a further indication of the benign nature of the virus.
Pre-existing cross reactive antibodies to pH1N1/2009 at titers $1/40 prevented from seroconversion in response to the pandemic virus.
Cross reactive antibodies triggered by pH1N1/2009 viruses and exposure to seasonal influenza epidemics .
Infection or severe disease, especially in the elderly, soon after the passage of the epidemic wave.
P pH1N1/2009 infection in older adults measured just after the epidemic peak was 20.4%.
The winter of 2010-2011 was the coldest winter on record in Australia.
Infection in 2010 was due to pH1N1/2009v, not pandemic virus isolates .
We used as proxy base line seroprevalence data from individuals recruited at the very beginning of the investigation when the epidemic activity in the cohort was very low.
A rather low threshold of 1/40 may underestimate the number of infected individuals.

We found high concentrations of multiple veterinary drugs, primarily fluoroquinolones, in failed eggs and nestlings in bearded vultures.
Combined impact of drugs and disease as stochastic factors may result in potentially devastating effects exacerbating an already high risk of extinction.
Environmental pollutants are increasingly documented as a driver of wildlife endangerment due to their roles in organ damage, hormonal disruption and alteration of the immune system.

A model of the emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 based on suspected convergence factors that are mainly associated with land-use change.
Urbanization combines risk factors to produce particular types of peri-urban landscapes with significantly higher HPAI H5N1 emergence risk.
Poultry production overlap increases the risk of EID.
Avian Influenza is the most significant newly emerging pandemic disease .
HPAI H5N1 has killed millions of poultry in countries throughout Asia, Europe, and Africa, and 402 humans have died from it in sixteen countries.
The convergence model proposes emergence events are precipitated by the intensifying of biological, environmental, ecological, and socioeconomic drivers.
The convergence model can be adapted by incorporating the dynamics of urban, agricultural, and natural ecosystem transformations proposed with this framework.
In this paper, we look at the emergence of a disease that can be caused by other diseases.

The role of extensive systems and intensive systems in biosecurity .
A diversity index of intensive and extensive systems of poultry-raising can better estimate the effect of such co-location.
A study of commune-level variables relevant to poultry management and the transmission and persistence of HPAI virus.
We used the urbanicity classification developed by Saksena et al. to define the urban character of each commune.
We measured land-use diversity using the Gini-Simpson Diversity Index .
The difference between the total area and the sum of the first four classes.
The following variables play a role in disease introduction, transmission and persistence, though some of these factors may have multiple roles.
Human population density in the United States, according to the United Nations.
Poultry trade and market • Poultry trading and market.
Town and cities were assumed to be active trading places . So, the distance to the nearest town/city was used as indicator of poultry trade.
Trade is facilitated by access to transportation infrastructure . So, the distance to the nearest a) national highway and b) provincial highway was used as indicator of transportation infrastructure.
In this paper, we look at the role of disease introduction and amplification.
The densities of chicken were calculated based on commune area .
Duck and geese densities in communes .
We found that scavenging in rice fields by ducks increases duck density in the area under rice.
We used percentage of land under rice cultivation as a measure of extent.
We used the mean number of rice crops per year as a measure of intensity.
The extent of aquaculture is a known risk factor , possibly because water bodies offer routes to transmission and persistence of the virus.
Proximity to water bodies increases the risk of outbreaks, possibly by increasing the chance of contact between wild water birds and domestic poultry.
Climatic variables have been associated with significant changes in risk .
Elevation, which is associated with types of land cover and agriculture, is a significant risk factor in Vietnam .
Compound Topographical Index in Ecological Niche Models of HPAI H5N1 .
 CTI is a function of both the slope and the upstream contributing area per unit width orthogonal to the flow direction.

 commune level data on HPAI H5N1 outbreaks .
Agriculture Censuses of Viet Nam.
We used the 2006 Agriculture Census for most variables because the first three epidemic waves occurred between the Agricultural Censuses of 2001 and 2006.
A three-way classification of the rural-to-urban transition .
Bioclimatic variables for commune level data .
Elevation was generated from SRTM 90 meter Digital Elevation Models acquired from the Consortium for Spatial Information .
We cleaned the data by identifying illogical values for all variables and then either assigning a missing value to them or adjusting the values.
We excluded a number of risk factors from consideration when |r| ! 0.5 .
Autoregressive Regression Trees with Spatial Autocorrelation .
The limit of the autocorrelation of the response variable was obtained from the range of the spatial correlogram ρ .
Boosted Regression Trees for HPAI H5N1 occurrence prediction .
BRT uses regression trees and boosting algorithms to fit several models and combines them for improving prediction.
We used regression trees to select relevant predictor variables and boosting to improve accuracy in a single tree.
We used log-transforms to eliminate predictors that are highly correlated with other predictors and to make log-Transforms where needed.
We used the corrected Akaike Information Criteria to compare GLMM models with and without its respective suite of fixed predictors.
We used SPSS version 21 for GLMM and R version 3.1.0 for the BRT.
Predicting HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in wave-place combinations based on univariate analysis .
The power of the GLMM models, as measured by the AUC, is very good.
Diversity of duck flock size is a more important predictor than duck density.
A global study of human cases also found occurrence to be higher under drier conditions .
Peri-urban areas have greater urbanicity and diversity than rural areas .
Land-use diversity was found to be significantly associated with HPAI H5N1 in both waves for Viet Nam, but at the delta level the association was significant only for Wave 2.
Land-use diversity had middle to below-middle rank of influence.
Diversity of chicken flock-size has strong association with HPAI H5N1 for both waves at the national level.
The GLMM model indicated that the CTI had a very strong association with HPAI H5N1 in both waves although this was not true in the two deltas.
We found the spatial autocorrelation term to have the highest rank of influence.
A limitation of using surveillance methods for the dependent variable is that the data may have reporting/detection biases .
We sought to test the hypotheses that measures of urbanization, land-use diversification, and poultry intensification are correlated with outbreaks in poultry.
Urbanization is not a significant independent risk factor for HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in peri-urban landscapes, where intensive and extensive forms of poultry production are co-located.
Peri-urban areas in Indonesia are significantly associated with HPAI H5N1 cases, even based on multivariate models.

A mutation in the microtubule severing enzyme Katnal1 1H is associated with changes in circadian rhythms, sleep and behaviour.
We associate KATNAL1 with such dysfunctions with important implications for clinical association studies.
The Katnal1 1H mutation was initially identified with a circadian deficit including a short free-running period and advanced activity onset, but subsequent ex vivo experiments using SCN slices of animals carrying the PER2::LUC reporter gene demonstrated no defects in SCN cellular rhythms.
A loss of function of Katnal1 is associated with a range of behavioural phenotypes, including changes in circadian activity, poor learning and memory, hyperactivity in a novel environment and deficits in USVs.
Mice with KATNAL1 1H/1H mice show hyperactivity in novel environments and delays in language acquisition.
Migration and morphology which may underpin such phenotypes.
Katnal1 1H/1H mice have a range of phenotypes associated with defects in schizophrenia.
Katnal1 is an important gene for ID and schizophrenia and should be considered in the pathology of these disorders.
In Katnal1 1H/1H mice, we would expect to see the same loss of catalytic function in neurons.
Katnal1 1H/1H mice demonstrate defects in motile cilia that can be linked to learning and memory problems in humans.
In Bardet-Biedl syndrome mouse models microtubule severing and structural defects such as abnormal lengthening and swellings along their length 41 have been described, similar to those we describe in Katnal1 1H/1H mice.
Size rather than an increased incidence of hydrocephalus, further suggesting the ciliary defects in these animals are mild compared to other ciliopathies.
KATNAL1 plays an important role in a variety of neuronal processes including neuronal migration, neuronal morphology and ependymal ciliary function.

The study detected the presence of RVA in different species of animals both in areas near the home and in areas located in fragments of forest, characterized as forest remnants, since they were located in cities that suffered high environmental impacts due to vegetal extractivism, pasture formation for cattle breeding, exploitation of natural
A study on the impact of the human population on the environment of Santa Bárbara.
Forest generates many consequences on the Amazonian biota, being able to alter the diversity and the composition of the animal communities in the fragments and even to interfere in the ecological processes.
RVA in animals may explain the possibility of dispersion of viral strains, since there is a proximity to the human population.
Poultry breeding close to homes and the forest ecosystem facilitates direct contact with possible sources of contamination, since the use of septic tanks is deficient and sometimes non-existent, which may facilitate or even increase the risk.
Viral dispersion throughout the environment, as shown in this study.
High rates of increase and analysis of land use in the researched areas may be important indicators of how these animals interact, since with deforestation, the populations of wild animals seek refuge in nearby communities facilitating the dispersal of infectious agents.
RVA circulation in forest fragments in the different forest fragments.
The RT-qPCR assay may be a useful alternative for the differential diagnosis of RV in possible coexisting mixed infections clinically indistinguishable such as those caused by other viral strains that cause gastroenteritis.
Diarrhea associated with RVA infections in pigs is an important cause of increased mortality and economic losses in Europe.
Different P genotypes of RVA strains interact with distinct blood group histological antigens and sialic acids via VP4 providing insight into regional prevalence and increased zoonotic potential.
Zoonotic transmission can be frequent, since the animals live in contact with humans and in precarious sanitary conditions.

A period of adaptation is necessary before the transferred cells are able to respond.

Sample means were compared using the Student's t test. Sample means were considered significantly different at p < 0.05.
We have devised an experimental system that permits the comparison of naïve and memory B cells expressing the same antigen receptor.
A high affinity monoclonal B cell capable of class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation .
AID/YFP + CD19 + HEL + AID/ YFP + B cells from the SW HEL .
B cells expressing AID/YFP being the dominant population . A fraction of the HEL-specific B cells underwent class switch recombination and at day 14 we recovered both IgM + IgG -AID/ YFP + cell populations.
The adoptive cell transfer strategy allowed the development of a primary immune response with B cell activation and expansion, induction of AID expression, class switch recombination and germinal center formation.
We studied the evolution of the B cell response and recovered 2-4x10 6 cells, number that remained stable up to week 20.
AID/YFP + memory cell populations recovered with that of naïve B cells .
MHC class II and down-regulated expression of CXCR5 .
DNA sequencing from sort-purified IgM + IgG + HEL + memory B cells from spleen of different recipient mice .
Active cell division in AID/YFP memory populations .
A large number of persisting AID/YFP + cells may represent terminal differentiation.
The number of antigen-experienced memory B cells correlated to the number of naïve B cells.
We studied the amplitude of the immune response by measuring the serum titers of HEL-specific IgG antibodies and enumerating the number of HEL+B cells recovered.
Memory B cells persisting at late time points can mount secondary IgG responses and persist after secondary transfer.
Memory B cells recover faster than naïve B cells in the absence of immunization .
AID/YFP + IgM + B cells in response to antigenic boost produced only limited amounts of IgM antibodies , little IgG antibodies, but did generate GL7 + B cell more efficiently than the IgG + memory B cell population.
Memory B cells following immunization failed to expand and 3 weeks after immunization cell recovery was similar to the retrieval observed in the non-immunized hosts .
Memory B cells must maintain functional activity in the absence of nominal antigen to be fully effective.
Memory B cell subsets are not the result of heterogeneity of initially responding naive cells, but originate from the differentiation of a single B cell.
A B cell clone that can be cloned.
Memory B cells persist as resting non-dividing cells in absence of competing cells .
We compared memory B cell subsets belonging to the same clone bearing the same high affinity BCR.
Memory B cells can persist in the presence of competing populations .
The number of memory B cells depends on the number of initial naïve B cells.
Number of naive B cells present in the peripheral B cell pool does not determine neither the intensity nor the final number of memory B cells in response to an optimal dose of antigen.
Mutated memory B cells can counter select any new mutant clones .
Memory B cell pool can be reconstituted from a relatively small number of antigen-specific cells.
Memory B cell expansion observed after immediate boost after adoptive transfer could be due to the lack in Rag-deficient hosts of the appropriate environment required for memory B cell survival and function.
Lymphocytes adapt and modify their immediate environment .
We show that it is possible to fully reconstitute a primary response and the establishment of antibody memory in immune deficient mice after adoptive transfer of antigen-specific B cells together with a population of monoclonal helper T cells.
AID/YFP + IgM + IgG + B cell subsets able to persist in a lymphopenic environment by cell division mimicking responses obtained in intact non-Tg mice .
Memory B cells could give rise to new GL7 + B cells, suggesting that full reconstitution of the memory B cell pool may require transfer of the different antigen-experienced B cell subsets.
Autonomous control of the memory B cell pool in response to an optimal dose of Ag did not rely on the number of the initially responding B cells.

Archazolid inhibition of H-ATPase in endothelial cells increases adhesion of tumor cells.
Tumor cells preferentially adhered to the β1-integrin ligand collagen and archazolid led to an increase in the amount of collagen on the surface of ECs.
Inhibition of v-ATPase by archazolid induces an adhesion phenotype in endothelial cells that promotes their interaction with cancer cells.
Vacuolar-type H + -ATPase is the major proton pump responsible for acidification of intracellular compartments in eukaryotic cells.
V-ATPases contribute to the acidic tumor microenvironment, which leads to the activation of proteases, thus facilitating tumor cell migration, invasion and angiogenesis.
Archazolid A and B are highly potent and specific inhibitors of v-ATPases .
Archazolid reduces migration of invasive tumor cells in vitro and cancer cell metastasis in vivo .
The role of v-ATPases in endothelial cells has only rarely been investigated.
Cell adhesion molecules and integrins expressed on cancer cells mediate cell adhesion of cancer cells onto endothelial cells .

MDA-MB-231 cells are allowed to transmigrate through the endothelial monolayer for 24 h.
HUVECs upregulate the gene expression of cell adhesion molecules by TNFα.
HUVECs were grown to confluence on 12-well plates before they were treated with archazolid for 24 h to induce the expression of cell adhesion molecules.
Staining the surface collagen on HUVECs on ice for 30 min .
Confluent HUVECs in 6-well plates were treated as indicated.
ImageJ version 1.49m was used for densitometric analysis.
Cathepsin B activity assay using non-denaturating M-PER .
The cathepsin B enzyme activity was proportional to the intensity of the fluorescence signal.
HUVEC Nucleofector Kit was used to transfect HUVECs.
The control vector pcDNA3.1 delta MCS used for our transfections was cloned on the basis of hCathepsin B and is therefore lacking almost the whole part of the multiple cloning site.
One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-hoc test .
We treated confluent HUVECs with up to 1 nM archazolid for 24 and 48 h and observed that this treatment has neither an influence on the metabolic activity nor on the release of LDH.
Inhibition of v-ATPase prevents the acidification of lysosomes in living cells.
Archazolid serves as an indicator of v-ATPase inhibition in HUVECs.
Archazolid treatment of endothelial cells increased the attachment of MDA-MB-231 cells onto the HMEC-1 monolayer after 120 min of adhesion .
Archazolid treatment enhances the adhesive properties of both micro-and macrovascular endothelial cells for metastatic tumor cells.
Inhibition of the v-ATPase might affect the expression of endothelial cell adhesion molecules on mRNA or protein levels.
Cell adhesion to collagen and fibronectin-coated plastic .
Interaction between MDA-MB-231 and PC-3 cells and collagen .
Archazolid increases the amount of surface collagen expressed by HUVECs as extracellular matrix .
Cathepsin B inhibition by archazolid leads to accumulation of collagen on endothelial cells .
Cell surface expression of ICAM-1, VCAM1, E-selectin and Ncadherin.
Inhibition of endothelial vATPase increases tumor cell adhesion to endothelial cells .
Targeting the proton pump v-ATPase for cancer therapy using myxobacterial natural product archazolid .
Inhibition of the v-ATPase in endothelial cells by archazolid significantly increased the adhesion of metastatic cancer cells and decreased the transendothelial migration of cancer cells.
Archazolid-induced tumor cell adhesion was mediated by β1-integrins expressed on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer and PC-3 prostate cancer cells as blocking of the integrin β1 subunit on these tumor cells reversed the pro-adhesive effect of archazolid
Fibronectin binds preferentially to cell adhesion molecules rather than with ECM proteins.
An impaired cathepsin B activity and expression in endothelial cells .
Inhibition of v-ATPase by archazolid impaired the mannose-6-phosphate receptor-mediated trafficking from the trans-Golgi network to prelysosomal compartments .
Cathepsin B can also degrade other extracellular matrix components such as fibronectin and laminin .
Archazolid affects endothelial cells in a similar way leading to inhibition of Ras signaling and reduced transendothelial migration of MDA-MB-231 cells.
We linked the function of v-ATPase to the adhesion and transmigration of tumor cells onto endothelial cells as well as to the remodeling of the extracellular matrix on the surface of endotocyte cells.

The hygiene team obtained clinical information from the patient's health care records, and members of the health care team were consulted if necessary to complete any missing information.
Evaluating the lethality of residents infected with norovirus .
Testing for the virus was not systematic and was decided by the physicians in each institution in the presence of clinical signs.
Stool samples sent to the National Reference Centre for Gastroenteritis Viruses for laboratory testing .
The National Reference Centre for Influenza Viruses uses RT-PCR to detect viruses.
The epidemiological context of each outbreak was defined according to whether the virus had been identified or not.
Sex, age, length of stay and autonomy status were described for all exposed residents.
Multi-level analysis with 2x2 tables .
NoV, Flu+, NoV-and flu-.
All-cause lethality rate per 7-day interval (in percentage)
The serial interval in days was the time period between the onset of symptoms of the last case in initial outbreak and the first case in the following outbreak .
The death rate and the impact of successive outbreaks was defined, and the number of 7-day intervals to take into account was defined.
All-cause lethality rates were calculated with the following formula: � 100).
Non-parametric tests were used to compare infection and lethality rates according to the studied parameters.
Covariate adjusted analyses were performed with two tables .
The French Data Protection Authority approved data collection and analysis and the local ethics committee approved the study protocol .
Data collected during routine care in the context of routine surveillance is rendered anonymous.
RTI outbreaks were more frequent than GE outbreaks .
Virus investigations confirmed a considerable number of norovirus-related GE outbreaks and influenza-related RTI outbreaks .
NoV+ versus NoV-context for GE surveillance in the NoV+ context.
Infection rate in the NoV + context was higher than the three other contexts: NoV-, Flu+ and Flu-.
Age, sex, and LOS are associated with significant variations in the infection rate .
The study of lethality rates in infected residents over the 56 days after onset indicated that there were significant variations for RTI but no change for GE.
The analysis of successive or simultaneous clusters in the same institutions was performed when the time period between the onset of symptoms of the last case in outbreak N and the first case in N+1 was �56 days.
The analysis of virus stratification of the 44 outbreaks showed the absence of successive clusters for the same category.
All cause lethality rates were studied according to individual parameters for the four 7 days intervals.
Flu+/age adjusted for autonomy were: Flu+, 0.41 ; Flu-, 0.42 .
Autonomy adjusted for age with stratification according to virus, sex and LOS showed that the effects were higher among subgroups of less autonomous residents in Flu+ outbreaks.
In the Flu+ context, data regarding vaccination status and oseltamivir prescriptions were available but not used in this study.
Infection and all-cause lethality rates in nursing homes during GE and RTI outbreaks.
Infection rates in influenza outbreaks and NoV outbreaks .
Older residents are more likely to be infected with influenza and norovirus .
Viruses while institutionalized may lead to susceptibility or possible increased immunity in some residents .
When elderly residents are exposed to the A virus, there are higher rates of infection and reinfection, and more significant effects on the institution than with other influenza types/subtypes.
Elderly nursing home residents are more susceptible to influenza infection than younger residents.
All-cause lethality rate of the infected residents in our study reflected global mortality including GE and RTI outbreaks.
In Flu-outbreaks, the relatively small number of deaths could have limited the power of statistical tests.
The influence of age and autonomy on mortality in the context of influenza outbreaks.
Age and autonomy are a reflection of resident's level of frailty.
In nursing homes, information about autonomy and age are easier to collect than data on comorbidities.
The present work has two main limitations: First, the virus information was incomplete . Consequently, some episodes in the levels with no available identification may also have been associated with influenza or norovirus.
First, the deaths of uninfected residents were not recorded in this protocol even though such data would have provided valuable information about the global epidemiological context.
Infection rates varied according to virus, sex, length of stay and age, and there were major differences in lethality depending on virus, age and autonomy score.

A new human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was quickly identified, and the associated disease is now referred to as coronav virus disease discovered in 2019 .
COVID-2019 seems to have similar clinical manifestations to that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 is of laboratory origin .
The absence of a logical targeted pattern in the new viral sequences and a close relative in a wildlife species are the most revealing signs that SARS-CoV2 evolved by natural evolution.
Claim that SARS-CoV-2 is a chimeric CoV with bat CoV S gene in the backbone .
A mouse-adapted SARS virus was generated by serial passage of an infectious wildtype SARS CoV clone in the respiratory tract of BALB/c mice.
Bat-derived coronaviruses cannot use human ACE2 as a receptor for entry into human cells .
A bat coronavirus can directly infect human airway cells to similar titres as SARS-CoV .
Aging mouse lungs, infection attenuated, and less virus antigen was present in the airway epithelium as compared to SARS MA15.
SARS-CoV-2 is undoubtedly distinct from SL-SHC014-MA15, with >6,000 nucleotide differences across
No credible evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is derived from the chimeric SL-SHC014-MA15 virus.
Claim that SARS-CoV-2 has HIV sequence in it is not HIV-1 specific but random .
We have withdrawn this report. We have withdrawn the report.
SARS-CoV-2 is a recombinant CoV generated in nature between a bat CoV and another coronavirus in an intermediate animal host.

Vaccination against Salmonella and Adenovirus using heterologous antigens.
A review examines the literature on this topic, and concludes that for bacterial vectors there can in some cases be an enhancement in immunogenicity, typically humoral, while for viral vectors pre-existing immunity is a hindrance.
Live, attenuated bacterial vaccines can be used to deliver heterologous antigens of bacterial, viral and parasitic origin into a variety of animal hosts .
LAB and E. coli as potential vectors for attenuated vaccines .

Adenovirus vectors stimulate innate and adaptive immune responses and induce both T and B cell responses .
Vectored vaccines can be used in the human population, but they need to satisfy several important criteria.
Whether the presence of pre-existing immune responses is detrimental for the further development of a vector-based vaccine scheme, or can augment responses to the vectored antigen.
Anamnestic response to Salmonella antigens .
A reduction in the antigenicity of the vectored antigen.
Pre-existing immune responses to Salmonella vector strain can compromise its ability to deliver heterologous vaccine antigen .
Pre-existing immunity in the host against Salmonella .
Pre-existing immunity against the Salmonella vector leads to stronger immune responses against the delivered antigen .
A study by Metzger and co-workers on human volunteers using Salmonella Typhi as a vector suggested that there was no change in the T cell immune response against the heterologous antigen in human volunteers who were exposed to empty vector in comparison with volunteers who are immunologically naive of the
Pre-exposure to homologous or heterologous Salmonella strains increases interleukin 4 response, irrespective of the strain to which mice were pre-exposed.
Exposure to homologous sera increases opsonin uptake .
Pre-existing immunity against the bacterial vector downregulates immune responses against the delivered heterologous antigen using similar or related vectors.

An option for short-term or perhaps therapeutic vaccination .
Using oral Salmonella vaccines to immunize against heterologous pathogens would be of enormous benefit.
Pre-existing immunity against vaccine vectors in chickens .
Competitive exclusion component to immunity, with the possibility of a competitive exclusion component, not discussed.
Pre-existing immune responses do not diminish immune responses against the delivered heterologous antigen, and a similar study by Starks et al. also concluded that prior exposure of mice to the empty Listeria vector did not influence anti-cancer immune responses.
Prior exposure to empty Listeria vector does not abrogate immune responses to the vectored antigen, but only reduces them somewhat.
The study by Vijh et al. indicated that exposure to the empty vector may completely abrogate immune responses against the delivered antigens .
Pre-existing immunity is a major obstacle of many viralvectored vaccines, such as Ad serotype 5 or herpes simplex virus type 1 .
Pre-existing anti-HSV immunity reduces, but does not abolish, humoral and cellular immune responses against the vaccine-encoded antigen .
Pre-existing vector immunity can be avoided by masking the Ad vector inside dendritic cells .
An examination of the relevant literature shows, there is a rather confusing picture, with some studies in fact indicating that pre-existing immunity may be a problem.
A friend, rather than a foe: that's the view of the president of the United States.
Boosting mice with heterologous antigen leads to downregulation of antibody responses.
Secretory IgA responses to Salmonella antigens .
Pre-exposing animals to homologous Salmonella vector leads to a significant reduction in CD8 + responses .
Cell-mediated immunity is more effective than viral vectors at reducing the immune response.
Pre-existing immunity against vaccine vectors attenuated influenza virus, with the ability to easily develop reassortants, will be useful in this context.
Immunological memory in the form of opsonizing antibody certainly plays an important role in the early uptake of Salmonella by macrophages and DC.
We have shown that mice are the most likely host to be targeted for the use of live Salmonella vectors, specifically where the vaccines are developed.
Prior exposure to the vector can influence the response, particularly for humoral immunity.

The response to the novel coronavirus outbreak in China suggests many of the lessons from the 2003 SARS epidemic have been implemented and the response improved as a consequence.
A novel coronavirus with an apparent link to a market that sells live fish, poultry and animals to the public.
A candidate vaccine was ready for initial laboratory testing and a 1000 bed hospital in Wuhan in 10 days.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has provided guidance for countries implementing entry screening at airports in countries showing transmission of the novel coronavirus.
This response is one of the swiftest, coordinated global responses to an emerging infectious disease the world has seen, but is it the appropriate response, will it be effective and is sustainable?
The 2019-nCoV outbreak in China, including Hong Kong , Macau and Taipei .
This outbreak and the response to it illustrate some key issues about how global preparedness and response capacity for outbreaks have evolved over almost two decades since the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic of 2002/3.
One of the critical lessons from the SARS experience was the absolute necessity to be able to coordinate the international resources that are available in an outbreak and to get them focussed on identifying priorities and solving problems.
Global Coordinating Mechanism for Influenza Data .
Sharing of information about emerging threats is a key factor in successfully preventing and managing emerging threats.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has praised the Chinese authorities for sharing information within days of the first clustering.
Working with journalists and the media to help them understand the science and epidemiology, particularly in a fast moving event, will improve risk communication.
Signs of the efforts of epidemiologists, infectious disease experts, national and international public health agencies and others engaging with journalists, there are also signs that this is not yet achieving it's goal.
The use of media and social media reports to supplement formal reporting mechanisms between countries and with WHO was advocated in the light of SARS experience.
The value of early indications of cases beyond the initial outbreak city have been detected and can supplement the global risk assessment and monitoring of the evolution of the outbreak.
Autoinfection in health workers is a serious and growing risk.
This study confirms the presence of a new class of cancerous tumours in the brain that can cause brain haemorrhages.
A novel coronavirus outbreak in China where a case infected significantly more contacts than the average.
The absence of control measures is not an excuse .
The current coronavirus outbreak in China could have a significant economic impact on the country.
The emergence of a novel coronavirus in China represents a test of the global capacity to detect and mange emerging disease threats.
The rapid sharing of information in this outbreak and the speed of the coordinated response both in the country and internationally suggest that lessons have been learned from SARS that improve global capacity.
Information deficit in the outbreak investigation is due more to the constraints of investigating an emerging disease than to any unwillingness to engage and share information with partners.
The media response to the unfolding events has been relatively balanced and informed but the nuances of the evolving situation have not been critically examined in partnership with the media.
SARS outbreak, along with aggressive case finding on case numbers, are examples of where understanding could be improved.
A look back at the events that led up to the 2016 Rio Olympics.
Early information from diverse sources including media and social media adds an important dimension to identifying and tracking new events globally and is a key part of the overall epidemic intelligence system.
Encodes appropriate risk avoidance actions and information that encourages inappropriate actions; however the public health is usually better served by more information rather than less.
The role of a declaration of a PHEIC in managing a serious outbreak has been questioned in the light of Ebola in West Africa and in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has been challenged again with this outbreak.
The Emergency Committee decided that the current situation, although an emergency, should not as yet be declared a PHEIC .
The World Health Organization (WHO) is working on improving the way in which Emergency Committees develop their advice for the Director General.
A key function of a PHEIC declaration is that it is the gateway to the WHO Temporary Recommendations on possible travel and trade restrictions to limit international spread of a disease.
We do not know whether quarantine measures will be effective; indeed we don't know how we will determine if they have been effective.
To 5 m people left Wuhan before the travel restrictions were imposed, the efficacy of these control measures will be more challenged.
In this paper, we look at the role and the effectiveness of public health measures on this scale.
The imposition of these dramatic measures does also raise a wider question: what other countries would implement such measures? Would other countries accept the self-imposed economic damage that China has accepted to try and contain this outbreak?
A review of the response to the Zika outbreak in the United States.
China's response to SARS was inevitably influenced by the historical reaction to the country's response and the world's suspicion of China's lack of cooperation.
A tendency to look at worst case scenarios and respond accordingly and a fear of 'getting it wrong'.
Emergency response should be on a 'no regrets' basismake the best decisions possible on the basis of the best information and science available at the time.
Risk assessment and response can then be modified and refined as information on the unknown evolves.
Confidence that decisions will not be criticised based on information that is not available at the time.
China should not be judged for implementing what might appear to be extreme measures but should also be prepared to discontinue the measures quickly if evidence suggests they are not the best way to solve the problem.

In this paper, we illustrate the mechanisms of Ab-mediated interference and the viral pathogens described in literature as able to adopt this evasion strategy.
Hypervariable viruses adopt several mechanisms to cope with the host humoral immune response.
 stimulation of subfamily-restricted antibodies and the possible interfering effect of non-neutralizing Abs .
Infected or vaccinated individuals may interfere with the neutralizing potential of nAbs.
Infection, infection, and infection, all in the same week.
Infections can be caused by a number of mechanisms, some of which are described in detail.
High risk of graft re-infection and rapid progression of the liver disease .
Viral escape mechanisms from humoral immune response against surface viral proteins: point mutations on immunodominant regions, glycosylation of functionally pivotal residues of the viral surface proteins and virus association with host serum components.
NAbs in black while nAbs in yellow.

Anti-HCV mAbs capable of targeting structurally and functionally conserved regions of the highly variable viral particles are being considered as novel therapeutic tools .
Control of viremia using quasispecies-specific neutralizing or high titer non-nAbs .
A recent paper has suggested that the effect of some of these nAbs, directed against functionally important residues involved in the viral binding to CD81 , could be hindered by the presence of non-nAbs binding residues within epitope II .
In vitro neutralization assays using serum-derived HCV of genotype 4a and polyclonal Abs derived from immunized goats with different conserved peptides spanning aminoacid residues 412-419, 430-447 and 517-531 of E2 glycoprotein .
Structured E1-E2 crystal is the best model available, but while this predicted structure is currently the best, these conclusions cannot be absolutely ascertained.
Existing epitope I is masked and can no longer be recognized by specific nAbs .
Interference by non-nAbs in the region encompassing residues 434-446 is not a possible mechanism for HCV persistence in chronically infected individuals.
Anti-HCV/E2 human mAbs binding conformation-sensitive epitopes encompassing also some residues within the 434-446 interfering region .
We found that e509 does not minimally interfere with the activity of two other broadly cross-neutralizing human anti-HCV/E2 mAbs.
R residues within epitope II, at a higher affinity compared to e509, thus displacing it from the interfering epitope and, therefore, keeping unaltered their neutralizing activity.
In this paper, using well characterized mAbs, we demonstrate the existence of interfering Ab populations and hypothesize their possible role in HCV persistence.
The paper shows that the interfering Ab subpopulations exist but that their overall effect may be biased by the presence of nAbs with different binding features and by the infecting HCV genotype.
The influenza viruses circulate worldwide in animal reservoirs, especially water fowl, potentially affecting humans of any age group.
A look at the state of the NHS in England and Wales.
Eight segments of negative single-stranded RNA are protected by the nucleocapsid protein, forming the ribonucleoprotein .
Viruses can subvert the synthetic capabilities of the host cell for production and release progeny particles .
A large body of experimental works suggests that occlusion of the receptor-binding site on HA by Abs is the main mechanism of influenza viral neutralization.
Escape from neutralizing mouse mAbs using three-dimensional H3 structure .
Non-nAb response during the first few days of infection may play a role in the outcome of an infection.
Non-Abs present in patients' sera during the early stage of infection were likely to be either preexisting or the result of a secondary heterosubtypic humoral immune response against more conserved epitopes on several influenza proteins .
A large number of peripheral B-cells generate high avidity non-nAbs, especially in patients with severe disease.
The mechanism of Ab neutralization interference has been indirectly speculated also by Ndifon et al, who observed that some aminoacid changes on HA actually increase the efficiency of neutralization of escape variants by previously generated Abs, even if not directly influencing their binding .
Binding to low-neutralization epitopes of HA increases the overall viral neutralization.
NAbs close high-neutralization efficiency epitopes, thereby impeding the neutralization of influenza viruses.
The influenza viruses may have evolved by favoring the preferential elicitation of Abs recognizing epitopes with a low-neutralization profile.
Vaccines induced by low-interference vaccine strain have low affinity for low-neutralization efficiency epitopes of the target circulating virus strain.
Antiviral drugs could be designed to include viral modifications at the level of high-neutralization efficiency epitopes; these "decoy" proteins would compete with virus for binding to low neutralization efficiency Abs in a manner similar to that played by neuraminidase inhibitors.
In synthesis, the availability of HA crystal structure has helped to confirm the existence and to explain the mechanisms of interference by non-or weakly-neutralizing anti-HA Abs.
SARS-CoV circulates in animal reservoirs and is thought to transmit the virus to small mammals with exposure to these small mammals as the source of human infections.
SARS case definition includes clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory criteria .
CoV use a discontinuous mechanism to transcribe a series of progressively larger subgenomic mRNAs.
The S protein is inserted in the envelope of the virion mediating binding and fusion events necessary for infection, and it is the major target of the humoral protective immunity .
S proteins in SARS-CoV are held together non-covalently; however, as in the case of human CoV 229E, the S protein is not cleaved.
Vaccine strategies aiming at blocking/limiting infection by SARS-CoV mainly focus on targeting the Sars-S viral glycoprotein .
MAb 240C and MAb 341C are proximal to each other but distal from the ACE2 receptor binding site .
The area of an Ab can range from 500 Å2 to 800 Å 2 corresponding to 21-32 aminoacids, although only 9-20 aminoacid residues make direct contact with the Ab .
A cocktail of human mAb that can bind to unique epitopes and have different mechanisms of action might be of clinical utility against SARS-CoV infection.

We used a large dataset of sequence data and genotypes from 22 microsatellite loci to characterize the lion Panthera leo's recent evolutionary history.

Level of population subdivision among lions using microsatellite and sequencing data .
Four captive lions from Angola and four Morocco Zoo Atlas lions were included in the analyses to explore the relationship of lions from more isolated, endangered, or depleted areas.
A study of isolation-by-distance in lion populations .
Onedimensional isolation-by-distance model performed better than two-dimensional isolation by distance for the mtDNA data .
The null hypothesis of regional equilibrium for mtDNA across the entire sampled region is rejected despite the possibility that isolation-by-distance may occur regionally.
Females are more phylopatric than males, and selection for matrilineally transmitted traits can hitchhike.
Lion populations underwent severe bottlenecks, leading to lower effective population size .
FIV is endemic in eight of the 11 GIR lion populations but absent from southern Botswana/Kalahari regions in Southwest Africa.
FIV Ple pairwise genetic distances among lion FIV-infected populations are not correlated with geographic distance .
FIV Ple has a large geographic area and linearized F ST estimates are better correlated with log geographic distance than with geographic distance .
The mtDNA coalescence dating suggested that the East African lineage I had an old origin of324,000 years .
Southern lions have a slightly more recent mtDNA coalescence than East Africa.
Co-occurrence of divergent mtDNA haplotypes in southern populations may be the consequence of further isolation within refugia during colder climatic periods.
Further isolation within refugia may also have occurred in East Africa, as suggested by the distinctive mtDNA haplotype H4 and the unique FIV Ple subtype F.
The best example of concordance between host genome markers and viral transmission patterns is observed in the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania.
FIV Ple subtypes are distributed ubiquitously in all three, characteristic of rapid horizontal retroviral transmission subsequent to host population admixture.
Lions colonized West Asia from East Africa 130,000-70,000 years ago .
A second, more recent lion expansion probably occurred at the Pleistocene/Holocene transition, this one from Southern Africa toward East Africa .
East African lion populations went extinct during the Pleistocene/Holocene transition ) and were then colonized by Southern populations.
FIV Ple subtype B found in UGA/SER-I/ser-II/ SER-III/NGC showed evidence of a population expansion and the highest nucleotide diversity observed within FIV ple subtypes.
FIV Ple is not a recent emergence within modern lions, and the extreme divergence among FIV Ple subtypes, considered with high sero-prevalence in eight of the 11 lion populations, and combined with patterns of geographic concordance, support the hypothesis.
FIV Ple pre-dates the Late-Pleistocene expansions of contemporary lion populations .
We found that lion numbers diminished considerably following the Late Pleistocene.
Lion distribution further eroded its genomic diversity, and microsatellite variation suggested recent population bottlenecks in seven of the 11 populations .
A bottom-up perspective that prioritizes populations, rather than large-scale units, might preserve and maintain lion diversity and evolutionary processes most efficiently .
Genetic variation in lion populations across most of the lion range .
The amplification protocol was: denaturation 10 min at 95uC, a touch-down cycle of 95u C for 30 s, 52uC for 60 s, and 72UC for 120 s, followed by an extension of 10 minutes at 72uC.

The phage particle is self-adjuvanting through multiple mechanisms, and its removal by polymyxin B chromatography reduces antibody titers against phage coat proteins .
The filamentous phage is not only a highly immunogenic carrier, but by virtue of activating a range of innate and adaptive immune responses, serves as an excellent model virus-like particle antigen.
The filamentous phage, with its nonlytic life cycle, has less obvious clinical uses, despite the fact that the host specificity of Inovirus and Plectrovirus includes many pathogens of medical importance.

Endospore formation in Clostridium difficile is governed by the key regulator for sporulation, Spo0A.
In vitro binding assays using purified C-terminal DNA binding domain of C. difficile Spo0A protein demonstrate direct binding to DNA upstream of spo0A and sigH, early sporulation genes and several other putative targets.
Direct targets of Spo0A protein in C. difficile.
Sporulation is an adaptive strategy that enables bacteria to survive harsh environmental conditions for prolonged periods of time, and is an integral part of the transmission of sporulating pathogens.
Spo0A is a response regulator that demonstrates phosphorylation dependent binding to DNA .
An isolated DNA binding domain can bind legitimate targets of Spo0A protein due to the absence of transcription inhibitory contacts, thereby bypassing the need for phosphorylation.
Spo0A regulates many other processes than sporulation, such as competence for genetic transformation, DNA replication, and biofilm formation in B. anthracis and Clostridium acetobutylicum .
Community acquired Clostridium difficile infection .
Clostridial toxins A and B, as well as certain strains of C. difficile, encode a binary toxin .
Spores formation and transmission in Clostridium difficile using Spo0A .
Spoil0A can be transcribed from a SigH-dependent promoter . It is unknown which genes are regulated by direct binding of Spo0A to their upstream regions.
We establish an in vitro binding assay for C. difficile Spo0A and demonstrate the first time direct binding of this transcription factor to DNA upstream of several putative target genes.
E. coli strains were routinely grown in Luria-Bertani broth or plates, supplemented with appropriate antibiotics.
Cycling conditions and plasmids for Pfu polymerase.
Plasmid pWKS1251 for the overproduction of Spo0A-DBD carrying a C-terminal 66His-tag.
Plasmid pWKS1245, for the production of full length Spo0A carrying a C-terminal 6xHis-tag, was constructed in a similar manner using chromosomal DNA from C. difficile 630Derm as a template, but using the PCR product of prim
Plasmids used as PCR templates for generating EMSA probes were constructed by cloning the PCR products into pCR2-TOPO.

Alignments of B. subtilis and C. difficile spo0A using ClustalW2 .
ImageQuant TL, Adobe Photoshop CS3 and Corel Graphics Suite X5 .
Spo0A is a Cterminally 66His-tagged protein in the heterologous host Escherichia coli and purified to near homogeneity using metal affinity chromatography .
We found that C. difficile Spo0A is present in lysates from exponential to stationary growth phase.
We obtained similar results in other media, such as supplemented brain heart infusion broth .
We performed an immunoblot experiment using fluorescent antibodies, which gives more quantitative information compared to the use of horseradish peroxidase conjugated antibodies.
Protein in active or inactive form is present throughout growth and is more abundant in stationary growth phase.
A homolog of B. subtilis Spo0A protein in C. difficile Strain 630Derm .
Strain 630Derm spo0A contains an 18 base pair direct repeat, resulting in a 6 amino acid duplication compared to the published reference.
A region of the protein with relatively low sequence conservation , flanking the highly conserved DNA binding domain .
Derm is a drug that can be used as a cancer therapy .
C. subtilis Spo0A-DBD Shows Similar Specificity as B. difficile .
DNA binding by full length Spo0A in B. subtilis requires phosphorylation dependent dimerization .
Spo0A binds to other 0A boxes in the abrB promoter .
We found that C. difficile Spo0A bound to DNA sequences upstream of spo0A and sigH.
The addition of Spo0A-DBD to the reactions caused retardation of the spo0A and sigH DNA fragments, but not of a spoVG fragment which did not contain a consensus 0A box.
One strong binding site for Spo0A in C. difficile .
Spo0A-DBD in C. difficile could potentially regulate genes that have no documented function in sporulation.
Spo0A-DBD protein binds to lplA gene and ssuA gene .
Spo0A binds to DNA upstream of spo0A and sigH, two genes that are important for sporulation, and indicate that Spo0A may have functions that go beyond the regulation of sporulation.
A Spo0A mutant of C. difficile does not produce any spores, consistent with a crucial role in the sporulation pathway .
A near-consensus box for Spo0A-DBD .
We consider the binding to spoIIAA, spoIIE and spoIIGA genes to be specific, despite the fact that increasing the amount of protein did not seem to cause a significant increase in DNA in the complex.
Spo0A in C. difficile might regulate the transcription of at least a subset of early sporulation genes by direct binding to their promoter regions.
We found evidence for direct binding of Spo0A-DBD to the region upstream of tcdB, encoding one of the major clostridial toxin genes.
We tested for tcdC, but this did not seem to result in lower toxin levels in our hands.
We tested the binding of Spo0A to DNA upstream of all open reading frames in the PaLoc, even though this regulator does not have a significant effect on toxin levels under the conditions we used.
Smearing of tcdA, tcdE and tcdR probes by DNA lacking such a site .
We found no lower toxicity towards Vero cells of culture supernatants derived from spo0A mutant cells compared to wild type.
Spoil0A mutant cells in glucose-free TTY medium .
Spo0A does not positively affect toxin production in C. difficile 630Derm and the in vivo relevance of the binding to regions upstream of tcdB and/or tcdC is therefore limited under our experimental conditions.
The Spo0A-box of C. difficile is a conserved core motif, flanked by one or more adenine or thymine residues . Interestingly, many target genes do not harbor a perfect match to this consensus sequence.
Spoil0A genes in B. subtilis can be divided in different classes that respond to different levels of phosphorylated Spo0A .
The purified DNA binding domain does not accurately reflect binding to all target sites, if target site selectivity is determined in part by other parts by of the full length protein.
The activation of Spo0A is controlled by a multi-component phosphorelay that can integrate environmental cues and ensures a gradual increase in the level of phosphorylated spo0A in the cell .
In C. difficile, there seems to be no phosphorelay and Spo0A is supposedly controlled by orphan histidine kinases .
The C. difficile genome does not harbor a homolog of the pleiotropic regulator AbrB, which is responsible for the Spo0A-dependent regulation of B. subtilis .
Spoil0A binding of Spo0A to DNA upstream of early sporulation genes, such as spoIIAA, spoIIE, and spoIIGA .
Spo0A-dependent repression of abrB .
In Clostridium difficile Spo0A is a direct regulator of solvent formation, as well as sporulation .
Spo0A encodes the key sigma factor for the transition phase, and regulates processes outside sporulation as well.
The presence of a putative Spo0A binding site upstream of these genes, as well as the spacing compared to the start codon, is conserved in the Stoke-Mandeville strain.
In vivo analysis of Spo0A binding profiles of the putative target genes.
Spo0A affects toxin production in B. anthracis and Clostridium perfringens .
TpeL, a member of the large clostridial toxins, is directly dependent on Spo0A and also the production of enterotoxin in this organism seems to be dependent on sporulation .
In C. difficile an insertional spo0A mutant generated using Clostron technology was reported to have ,10-fold reduced levels of toxin A , both intracellularly and extracellularly as well as ,1000-foldred toxicity towards Vero cells, which are primarily
Toxin levels were slightly elevated in spo0A mutant cells compared to wild type .
A list of diseases that can cause death in humans .
The differences between Underwood et al and our study as well as the study of Deakin and coworkers on the other hand may be explained by differences in experimental conditions, such as the medium used.
The absence of a complementation experiment and/or Southern blot data, this remains to be established.
Spo0A is not a negative regulator of toxin production in Clostridium difficile.
Direct binding of C. difficile Spo0A to putative target DNA.
By Spo0A in C. difficile may shed light on the role of the protein in virulence and pathogenesis.
Binding of Spo0A-DBD-his6 to the upstream region of tcdB is reversed by the addition of PabrB and/or PtcdA.
