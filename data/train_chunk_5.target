The number of individuals in each of the daytime locations for Madang, Albany and Madang-nnh models is given in Table A1 in the Supplementary Data File.
Reduced compliance with home isolation of school children following school closure increases the attack rate in Albany as those affected make additional daytime contacts with other children.
We assume that influenza symptoms develop one day into the infectious period 1 , with 20% of infections being asymptomatic among children and 32% among adults.
A small, local workplace was created to locate individuals denoted as wage-job with known workplaces.
The simulation period was divided into 12 hour day/night periods and during each period a nominal location for each individual was determined.
Social distancing intervention strategies suitable for a developing country may be significantly less effective in reducing the attack rate when compared to that of a developed country.
We asked the headmasters of schools and colleges, human resource department at DWU and business owners of small to medium scale businesses about the respective numbers and, if no records existed, relied on their estimates.
One new infection per day was introduced into the population during the whole period of the simulations, and randomly allocated to a household.
School closure based interventions are less effective in a PNG setting since they are not targeted at household transmission, and given the larger household sizes, are applicable to a smaller proportion of transmissions.
Voluntary withdrawal from work or school has a more pronounced effect in the Albany model, as a significant proportion of children in Madang still transmit through daytime contacts.
We have expanded the methods section of the manuscript, giving an outline of the contact and transmission mechanism used, specifically stating the data sets used to calibrate the model to produce location and age specific transmission rates.

Moral Shangri-La is rich with moral technologies.
A moral struggle is a set of experiences in which an agent fails to act in accordance with their own convictions.
As individuals offload moral decision-making to technologies or the built environment, the worry might arise that some of the skills, cognitive or affective, necessary for this kind of moral innovation will be lost.
The Aristotelian-style objection has to do with the extent to which being moral interferes with the criteria for behaving virtuously.

Epidemic models with age and household structure are among the most analytically tractable, and are thus particularly suited to rapid use in emerging epidemic situation.
Household structure is less relevant than age for predicting disease dynamics .
We have focussed on age and households only. Other forms of social structure exist, which are more relevant and even reasonably well informed by data .
The household SAR is then computed as ∕, where χ v is the average size of household infected in that phase .

The general idea of how the NGM is constructed from more fundamental parameters is described in this section, with non-indexed symbols.
R g 0 is the dominant eigenvalue of K g , which gives an intuitive measure of the amount of transmission occurring in the community.
R 0 depends on i) their age class, ii) the age class of the primary case of the household epidemic and iii) the generation they belong to.
Whereχ andμ are the average household size and the average epidemic size observed in the study.
Household epidemics started with a single initial infective of type p in a household with n a adults and n c children.
This paper proves that the next generation matrix A can be defined in terms of γ A .
Approximation of distribution {π n } because children could be more susceptible than adults, and hence more likely to be household primary cases.
A major outbreak is defined as an outbreak infecting more than 1% of the population, including the n 0 initial infectives.
We take as mixing parameters for the UK, θ g = 0.58 and γ g =0.75 and, for simplicity, use a single parameter for all of them.
