The Madang-nnh model leads to an increase in illness attack rate compared to that resulting from the Albany model.
Social distancing-based interventions strategies were 60% -70% less effective in a PNG setting compared to an Australian setting.
Contact between the wider Madang population and those at the University involved household and neighbourhood contacts for local students and staff living in town while resident staff and students were restricted to community contact.
We conducted experiments with the Madang-nnh model where neighbourhood contact hubs were omitted, to contrast the transmission characteristics with and without these contact hubs.

Quantitative risk-benefit analysis can and should be quantitative .
Risk aversion, risk appetite, and/or risk-taking strategy .
We doubt that GOFR should actually be pursued in the hypothetical example above-the idea being that it would be too risky to pursue a course of action that has a nontrivial possibility of killing 2,500,000,000 people even if expected utility would be maximized.
Cass Sunstein argues that the strongest version of the precautionary principle would be incoherent, because serious dangers will be possible outcomes of any course of action.
Risk-exposure is part of an equitable system for risktaking that works to the advantage of risk-exposed persons.
In the case of GOFR, imposing risks on individuals without their individual consent might be ethically problematic in a way that is similar to what is problematic about coercive public health measures.
Manageability of GOFR risks, like other relevant features considered above, is a matter of degree rather than either-or.
Ethical acceptability of GOFR at least partly depends on the extent to which such research is accepted abroad.
