Large-scale gatherings of people with infectious diseases can place a severe strain on local health and other support services.
The International Human Rights Council (IHR) has proposed new regulations for planning mass gatherings.
 Strategic risk assessment helps public health planners, and others, identify health risks and determine realistic goals for reducing exposures, in order to reduce or eliminate public health threats.
Risk is mainly a function of two variables: the probability of an event occurring, and the effects of that event.
The likely immunity of attendees and participants to potential infections, and their level of knowledge about infectious diseases and immunities •
Health events where the underlying agent, disease or mode of transmission is new, newly-discovered, or unknown at the time of notification.
Building links between the CD surveillance system and other agencies that may have relevant data • Inclusion of relevant information from non-health sectors • Developing standard operating procedures for rapid establishment of active surveillance.
The first indication of a problem could be the inexplicable and rapid onset of symptoms such as respiratory distress, and the incapacitation of attendees, participants or staff.
A high altitude event can pose a significant health issue, especially if the attendees come from less elevated regions.
Operating effective external quality control procedures for rapid identification of unknown pathogens in clinical and environmental samples.
The most important factor for planning outbreak management during an MG is the increased complexity of performing any of the tasks associated with case management due to the extraordinary diversity and disorder associated with an MG.
The need for special equipment and medical supplies, respirators, oxygen, tubing and parts, antibiotics and other medications.
Security of medical facilities against contaminated/infectious self-presenters.
Mass Prophylaxis plans for large gatherings should also be made carefully in advance, to ensure that visitors and local populations have timely access to necessary antibiotics and/or vaccines.
Large-scale outbreak response using "push" and "pull" strategies .
Quarantine should be used in limited circumstances, and quarantine should therefore only be used for limited circumstances.
Communications channels with the various organizations that may be involved, such as law enforcement and judicial agencies, and with relevant foreign embassies and consulates o Make sure everyone involved in the MG is aware of the various plans and procedures involved in declaring and maintaining quarantine.
In preparing the alert and response plans for outbreaks in MGs, there are a number of broad and general issues that should be considered.
Toxins produced by micro-organisms, such as the botulinum toxin produced by Clostridium botulusum, are toxic chemicals which may be produced in vitro and disseminated in a form able to cause almost immediate disabling or lethal effects.
Command and control structures for MGs will involve many organizations and ministries. To ensure they work well, and that lines of communication between various ministries are open and functioning, components of the MG plan should be exercised prior to the event.
Maintaining lines of authority and responsibilities for the public information team during an emergency, for multiple audiences and formats.
Are there compatible and secure communications structures that allow the CDD and his staff to guide and direct the SLE?
An agreement on the procedures and the financial rules for exchanging advice or expertise internationally.
Efforts to address religious and cultural medical and health needs at an international event.
A single communications plan can be used and updated to ensure that the communications system is sufficient to meet the needs of the organization.
A disease outbreak or other health emergency that happens during an MG may lead to increased demand for psychological support services.
The response to the emotional and psychological effects of the MG should be integrated into the overall incident management.
