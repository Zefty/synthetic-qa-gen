Decomposition of hospitalisation rate and mean duration of stay per visit.
We measure change in hospitalization days in the community during this period, we compute the ratio of average population-based admission days between year a and year b.
Improvement in the management of patients has been offsetting by the reduction of the mean duration of the number of days per visit, resulting in a 30% reduction of hospitalization days.
We use the decomposition method to examine and quantify the impact of the mean duration on the other two factors: total number of patients per 1,000 people of the general population, and the mean number of visits per year.
The contribution of the decomposition method to the differences in mean length of stay, frequency of admission, and hospitalization rate.

The critics would contend that as long as a retrospective diagnosis is presented as evidence for some larger proposition in the humanities and social sciences, it is necessary that such a diagnosis come with acceptable proof or verification, which is unavailable.
