Is NTCP sufficient to allow HBV infection? <BM25> Looking forward, we need to understand how NTCP interacts with both HBV envelope proteins and with other cellular proteins, especially through the motif embedded in the cell membrane. NTCP itself is not sufficient to allow HBV infection, as the majority of HepaRG cells were found to express NPCT but not to be infected . NTCP might initiate or mediate molecular interactions that can overcome the cell-surface restrictions for viral entry. Such cooperative cellular or viral factors have to be discovered and demonstrated to enhance the efficiency of viral infection, at a level comparable to a natural one . For example,
Why is NTCP thought to not be sufficient for HBV infection? <BM25> gradually increased during first several days of infection and reached a steady level after day 5 . Together these data show that NTCP contributes substantially to HBV infection.

What method is useful in administering small molecules for systemic delivery to the body? <BM25> Intranasal entry has long been used to administer small molecules, such as proteins, for systemic delivery. Because the nasal mucosa is highly vascularized, delivery of a thin epithelium of medication across the surface area can result in rapid absorption of the medication into the blood. Therefore, siRNAs administered intranasally might be deposited in the nose, and some of them may be unable to reach the lower respiratory tract. In fact, it has been reported that intranasal application of unformulated siRNAs resulted in lower delivery efficiency and homogeneous pulmonary distribution than that achieved with intratracheal application . The intranasal method is
Why is the nasal mucosa useful in the delivery of small molecules into the body? <BM25> Intranasal entry has long been used to administer small molecules, such as proteins, for systemic delivery. Because the nasal mucosa is highly vascularized, delivery of a thin epithelium of medication across the surface area can result in rapid absorption of the medication into the blood. Therefore, siRNAs administered intranasally might be deposited in the nose, and some of them may be unable to reach the lower respiratory tract. In fact, it has been reported that intranasal application of unformulated siRNAs resulted in lower delivery efficiency and homogeneous pulmonary distribution than that achieved with intratracheal application . The intranasal method is
What are the most common methods of inhaled delivery of medications? <BM25> As the CF Physiotherapists are responsible for inhalation therapy they should be familiar with techniques, equipment provision and appropriate maintenance of devices. There is a need for consideration of timing of inhalations in relation to airway clearance as there may be a positive interdependence between the two. Education of patients in appropriate inhalation techniques is essential for optimal deposition of inhaled drugs. The CF Physiotherapist should be familiar with the appropriate nebulizer systems proven to be safe and effective in the delivery of the medications prescribed. Cleaning and maintenance of the whole nebulizer system are essential to ensure that medications
What medications have shown good promise to in vivo delivery via dry powder inhalers? <BM25> actuation and inhalation coordination. For most MDIs, the propellant is one or more gases called chlorofluorocarbons . Although CFCs in drugs are safe for patients to inhale, they are harmful to the environment. Therefore, further development of inhalable siRNAs may not be the best way forward. DPIs are devices that deliver medication to the lungs in the form of dry powder. The use of DPIs has already shown promise for the in vivo delivery of therapeutic macromolecules such as insulin and low-molecular-weight heparin ; thus, it could be a better device for delivering siRNAs to the lungs. The advantages of
How are siRNAs typically delivered for systemic effect? <BM25> The expressions of IFN-γ and IL-17 indicate the activity of Th1/Th17 responses.

What size of particle has been shown to be most effective in the delivery to the lower airway? <BM25> terms of size, charge, shape, velocity and density. For efficient pulmonary siRNA delivery, the particles must be deposited in the lower respiratory tract. Deposition in the airway is affected by the particle size and patient's pulmonary function. A particle size between 1-5 μm is found to be the most appropriate for deposition at the lower respiratory tract . In addition, the presence of mucus and surfactant proteins, the mucociliary clearance actions, and phagocytosis by macrophages present major barriers to targeted pulmonary delivery. Therefore, delivery systems usually require delivery vectors, and these vectors need to be designed in order to maximize

What is fulminant hepatitis? <BM25> in the liver, then fulminant hepatitis developed.
How does Prothrombinase Fgl2 affect the coagulation process? <BM25> Prothrombinase Fgl2 belongs to the fibrinogen superfamily and is produced by activated macrophages or endothelial cells, transforming prothrombin directly into thrombin, so as to quickly initiate the process of coagulation. This promotes the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin, resulting in thrombosis . Our study found that Fgl2 was highly expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in liver tissue of humans or mice with severe viral hepatitis, and was positively related to the severity of the disease . Gene therapy targeting Fgl2 silencing showed that the survival rate of fulminant hepatitis mice increased from 0 to 33.3% . Thus far,

What is the Boosted Regression Tree method? <BM25> Macroecological traits of flaviviral hosts. We constructed a generic model using the generalized boosted regression tree method for all flaviviruses and developed three stratified models based on virus cluster Groups 1, 2, and 3 and independent models for TBEV, JEV, and DENV to predict if a species is a flaviviruses host . Although TBEV shared hosts similar to WNV, SLEV, and USUV, it was modeled separately as it is transmitted by ticks while the other viruses are transmitted by mosquitoes. The optimal number of recursive trees where the holdout deviance was minimized in our models varied from 1,250 to 11,200
What is the advantage of Boosted Regression Tree method? <BM25> Macroecological traits of flaviviral hosts. We constructed a generic model using the generalized boosted regression tree method for all flaviviruses and developed three stratified models based on virus cluster Groups 1, 2, and 3 and independent models for TBEV, JEV, and DENV to predict if a species is a flaviviruses host . Although TBEV shared hosts similar to WNV, SLEV, and USUV, it was modeled separately as it is transmitted by ticks while the other viruses are transmitted by mosquitoes. The optimal number of recursive trees where the holdout deviance was minimized in our models varied from 1,250 to 11,200
What is the relationship between land use and emergence of HPAI H5N1? <BM25> The initial HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in Vietnam represent an ideal opportunity to adapt and test a CAS-convergence model. Emergence risk should be highest in the most rapidly transforming urban areas, peri-urban zones where mixes of urban-rural, modern-traditional land uses and poultry husbandry coincide most intensely. Specifically we hypothesized a positive association between the presence of HPAI outbreaks in poultry at the commune level and: 1) peri-urban areas, as defined by Saksena et al. , 2) land-use diversity, and 3) co-location of intensive and extensive systems of poultry.
Where is the highest risk of  HPAI H5N1 like disease emergence? <BM25> thereby increases direct opportunities for contact with wild avians . This was noted as a risk factor for emergence and outbreaks of HPAI in Vietnam .
How does land use fragmentation increase the risk of flu-like diseases? <BM25> resource or dispersal limitation are most susceptible. Consequently, ecological functions that are associated with such groups bear an increased risk of being lost when land use is increased.
What is the relationship between the outbreak of HPAI H5N1 like diseases and rice cultivation? <BM25> between mosquitoes and hosts like pigs and/or birds. Transmission of JE virus is predominant in rural agricultural areas, often associated with rice cultivation and flooding irrigation . Therefore, outbreaks are mainly associated with the rainy period which falls in summer and fall season in India .
What is the relationship between aquaculture and spread of H5N1 like diseases? <BM25> The "Healthy Housing" programme was designed as a specific anti-poverty measure to reduce the spread of infectious diseases like meningococcal disease. In New Zealand, 30% of the admissions for infectious diseases are children.
What is the relationship between proximity ofwater bodies to agricultural lands and spread of H5N1 like diseases? <BM25> The negative association with agricultural land uses is contrary to previous work, but specific types of agricultural use may vary in their importance to opossums. Additionally, proximity of agricultural lands to other important habitat components such as forest that provide den sites may be very importantmost agricultural land within the study area is devoid of trees and separated from forested areas.
What is the effect of diversity of chicken flock on H5N1 disease? <BM25> Both the GLMM and BRT models indicated that the diversity of chicken flock-size had a strong association with HPAI H5N1 for both waves at the national level. This was generally found to be true at the delta levels with some exceptions. The diversity of duck and goose flock size was also significantly associated with HPAI H5N1 in all places, but the associations were much stronger in Wave 2 than in Wave 1.
What is Compound Topological Index and how is it related to the risk of disease transmission? <BM25> From our findings, we believe that the WHO could narrow the criteria for initiating air travel-associated contact investigations to, for example, only smearpositive TB, as is recommended by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control in the risk assessment guidelines for infectious diseases transmitted on aircraft related to TB . As the ECDC guideline further recommends, the infectiousness of the index case, such as transmission to household members or other close contacts, should be considered before initiating air travel-associated contact investigations . As modelling studies suggest, the risk of contracting TB infection on an aircraft varies from low to

What will be the drug of choice for treating COVID-19 between Chloroquine and Remdesivir? <BM25> We have recently reported that two drugs, remdesivir and chloroquine phosphate, efficiently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro 1 . Remdesivir is a nucleoside analog prodrug developed by Gilead Sciences . A recent case report showed that treatment with remdesivir improved the clinical condition of the first patient infected by SARS-CoV-2 in the United States 2 , and a phase III clinical trial of remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 was launched in Wuhan on February 4, 2020. However, as an experimental drug, remdesivir is not expected to be largely available for treating a very large number of patients in a timely manner. Therefore,

What is the effect of Chloroquine(CQ) and Hydroxychloroquine(HCQ) on endosomal maturation and endocytosis in COVID-19 treatment? <BM25> the extracellular medium besides its early effect on viral endocytosis. These results are in agreement with our experimental findings using BAF . For some viruses like poliovirus, vesicle acidification promotes maturation of the assembled, encapsidated virus particles into infectious virions . In the case of JUNV, we can speculate that late membrane fusion events related to the viral assembly and budding, as could be the fusion of autophagosomes and MVBs or the plasma membrane, are also affected by post-infection treatment with BAF.
Evidence of Hydroxychloroquine(HCQ) being anti inflammatory in SARS-CoV-2 critically ill patients with elevated plasma cytokines? <BM25> A retrospective cohort study of 74 2009 H1N1 patients found that higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in plasma were observed in the ARDS-death group compared with the survived-without-ARDS or the mild-disease groups . Another study in critically ill patients with ARDS caused by 2009 H1N1 virus infection has shown that the hallmarks of disease severity were elevated levels of IL-6, IL-15, IL-8 and TNF-a . We examined the levels of five cytokines and chemokines in infected mouse lungs and found significant differences between the virus-infected and mock groups. It has proved that high levels of IL-6 were able

What are microtubule severing enzymes? <BM25> Recent studies have demonstrated that mutations in some microtubule severing enzymes can cause defects in cilia. 5 Since such ciliary defects could underlie the phenotypes described above we studied the motile cilia of the ependymal lining of the lateral ventricle in sections of postnatal day 2 mouse brains from both Katnal1 1H/1H and wild-type animals . We found that the ciliary beat frequency of Katnal1 1H/1H animals was significantly attenuated compared to wild-type . This reduction in CBF in Katnal1 1H/1H animals was also associated with an increased proportion of cilia with an abnormal beat pattern . Visual inspection of
What genetic mutation is associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia? <BM25> for polymorphisms in LITAF. KIF1A encodes a protein involved in anterograde transport of organelles along axonal microtubules, and KIF1A mutations have been associated with spastic paraplegia and hereditary sensory neuropathy , while KIF1B encodes for a protein involved in apoptosis and axonal transport of membranous organelles. Mutations to KIF family genes have been associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A, while LITAF mutations have been associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1C . In Hispanic patients, the polymorphism with the lowest P value for association with all grades of peripheral neuropathy was in NEFL, which encodes the neurofilament light polypeptide. Mutations in
What genetic mutation is associated with cerebral malformations? <BM25> Cystatin C amyloid deposits have been demonstrated to be associated with two types of brain hemorrhage. One type is the dominantly inherited form of cerebral hemorrhage, which is caused by a mutation in the cystatin C gene and displays amyloid deposition of the cystatin C variant but no co-deposition of amyloid [3-protein. The other type comprises the cerebral hemorrhage conditions, which are connected with cerebral deposition of amyloid [3-protein and display co-deposition of wildtype cystatin C in the amyloid.
What genetic mutation is associated with autism? <BM25> Recent evidence from genetic characterisation of human patients suggests that haploinsufficiency of KATNAL1 is linked with a number of symptoms including intellectual disability and craniofacial dysmorphologies. 8, 9 It is also notable that a very rare KATNAL1 mutation has been associated with schizophrenia 10 and that Peters syndrome and autism have both been associated with the chromosomal region containing the KATNAL1 locus. 11, 12 Although such association studies strongly suggest that KATNAL1 plays a fundamental role in the central nervous system , additional studies using cellular or animals models are required to understand how the gene may be causative for

What organ is most associated with the KATNAL1 gene? <BM25> variability and decreased sympathetic control are associated with mortality and organ failure .
What CNS functions can be measured by studying the movement of mice in a T-maze? <BM25> We therefore decided to determine whether macrophage-microglia in the CNS have the same immunoregulatory functions as other cells of monocyte lineage. In order to approach this, we isolated a pure population of macrophage-microglia from primary dissociated mixed brain cell cultures of normal newborn mice.
What CNS functions are changed by mutations in the KATNAL1 gene? <BM25> The results of these studies provide a link between CFTR and neuronal functions of the central nervious system. Second, mutation or alteration of this molecule may induce CNS dysfunction in CF or other neural diseases. More than 1,500 mutations of CFTR gene have been identified in CF . Different mutations can result in different disorders, including the failure of CFTR trafficking to the cell membrane, reduced channel activity, and abnormal splicing of the CFTR mRNA . When these mutations of the CFTR gene occur as in CF, the functions of CFTR in neurons may be altered, thus affecting the normal
How is Japanese encephalitis transmitted? <BM25> Flaviviruses are small, enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses that cause serious diseases in humans and animals . Most flaviviruses are arthropod-borne viruses transmitted to vertebrate hosts by either mosquitoes or ticks . Several members of the flavivirus genus, such as the Zika virus , dengue virus , yellow fever virus , West Nile virus , Japanese encephalitis virus , and tick-borne encephalitis virus , are highly pathogenic to humans .

What is the size of a flavivirus? <BM25> In recent decades, many new flavi-like viruses have been discovered in different invertebrates. All of them share homology in nonstructural proteins with the well-studied flavivirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS5 and RNA helicase-protease NS3, but they differ greatly from each other regarding other proteins, as well as in overall genome size and structure .
How many open reading frames are in the flavivirus genome? <BM25> open reading frames than any other.
What are the structural protein elements of a flavivirus? <BM25> MFold was used to test the ability of these regions to form SL6-like structures within each MBFV group and the stem and loop elements of these SL6-like structures were superimposed onto the TBFV/MBFV alignment . This comparison revealed that structures predicted within each MBFV group show not only sequence but also structural homology with SL6 of the TBFV group. This alignment was further annotated with RNA structures predicted by the ALIDOT-based analysis of entire flavivirus genomes of 11 000 nt , i.e. JE2, JE3 and JE4 for JEV; DV2 and DV3 for DENV and YF4 for YFV . For all

What is required to establish a secondary immune response to a viral infection? <BM25> OAS3-induced genes during viral infection in the major viral target-cell type, human macrophages, is required to understand the antiviral immune response.
What do immunoglobulin isotype recombination and somatic hyper mutation depend on? <BM25> Immune responses to infectious agents have different out-comes that can either protect or fail to control disease. Protection from re-infection relies on the establishment of efficient secondary immune responses that require the generation of antigen-specific "memory" B and T lymphocytes. The generation and selection of T-cell dependent "memory" B cells involves distinct molecular mechanisms: immunoglobulin isotype recombination and somatic hyper mutation, both dependent on the expression of AID . Therefore, a long-standing paradigm defined memory B cells as IgM -IgG + isotype switched cells . Different lines of evidence indicate that this is not always the case. In humans, it
What was used to quantify the amount of IgM secreting cells? <BM25> predominate, but by days 7-10 ASC secreting IgG2a predominate, and this is particularly evident when one examines the percentage of SV-specific ASC secreting IgM and IgG2a at day 20 .

When is SSA generally employed? <BM25> An improved ANFIS model is proposed using a modified FPA algorithm, using SSA.
What is the main idea behind the proposed model? <BM25> The main idea behind our model is to use information available on signals to assess both the probability of an infectious contact and the diagnostic procedure. The basic reproduction ratio, R 0 , is seen as the number of secondary infections caused over one generation, after the introduction of a single infected individual in an entirely susceptible population. This definition is coherent with another, introduced by Diekmann et al. , based upon the next generation operator. We believe it is interpretable and suitable for our purposes. Within the context of the proposed model, it is a random variable and, as

For what SCA algorithm was applied to improve the ANFIS model ? <BM25> to the ANFIS parameters to enhance time series forecasting because these parameters have a significant effect on the performance of ANFIS. The SI methods include the particle swarm optimization , social-spider optimization , sine-cosine algorithm , and multi-verse optimizer . For example, in SCA algorithm was applied to improve the ANFIS model to forecast oil consumption in three countries, namely, Canada, Germany, and Japan. In the same context, in , The MVO algorithm was used to enhance the ANFIS model to forecast oil consumption in two countries. In addition, in the PSO was used with ANFIS to predict biochar yield.

What virus are used by the most successful neuronal circuit tracing methods? <BM25> Members of the Herpesviridae family include pathogens of the mammalian nervous system with characteristic latent, recurring infection. The Alphaherpesviridae subfamily contains important human-pathogenic viruses such as herpes simplex virus-1 and varicella zoster virus that can invade the peripheral and central nervous system of the host. Another member of this subfamily Pseudorabies virus has been used for neuronal circuit tracing to visualize synaptically connected neurons in mammalian hosts but also serves as a model to study infection of neurotropic viruses. PRV infection in mice shows symptoms of acute peripheral neuropathy with manifestations of peripheral pain or itching that result in self-mutilation

What determines the whether the spread of Vesicular stomatitis virus is monosynaptic or polysynaptic? <BM25> Recently, we created an anterograde monosynaptic virus that complements the previously available retrograde viral tracers . Vesicular stomatitis virus , a virus related to RABV, with its own glycoprotein gene , or with a G from the unrelated lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus , spreads in the anterograde direction across synapses. VSV can be used as a polysynaptic tracer that spreads across many synapses, owing to the fact that the normal, replicationcompetent form of the virus does not cause serious diseases in humans . Whether the virus is a monosynaptic or polysynaptic tracer is determined by the method of delivery of the
What types of viruses can be used to study the connectivity of neuronal circuitry? <BM25> rVSV vectors can be used to study the connectivity of neuronal circuitry. In addition to combinations of replication-competent forms of VSV, the replication-incompetent, monosynaptic forms of the virus can be easily combined, without the need to change viruses . This allows a straightforward way to study both the projections into, and out from, a genetically defined cell population. This can be done with the same viral genome, with the only change needed being the glycoprotein, for the selection of the direction of transmission. This flexibility of VSV makes it a powerful, multi-application vector for studying connectivity in the CNS.

Is there a dose-dependent response to carageenan and Zanamavir intranasal therapy? <BM25> Neuraminidase inhibitors -oseltamivir, zanamavir and peramivir can be used for treatment or prophylaxis. Detailed information is available on the web sites of WHO and CDC . Individuals with severe influenza or with high risk for the same, benefit from therapy, particularly when initiated within 48 hours of onset of symptoms -and may be beneficial even if delayed beyond 48 hours . Persons on intensive care may benefit from doubling the dosage and duration of treatment . Reports of resistance to oseltamivir are a cause for concern; zanamavir or peramavir should be used in oseltamivir-resistant cases .
Do carageenan and Zanamavir together have a greater benefit than either in monotherapy? <BM25> have effector functions via signaling through FcγRIIIa , or combine both activities show benefit in vivo when administered as a monotherapy. Taken together, the in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that each of the 3 mAbs selected has a different binding and functional activity profile that confers protection from disease and lethality in an in vivo model of EBOV disease.
Did the use of carageenan play a role in pandemic's caused by novel viruses? <BM25> not play a major role in the 1957 pandemic, in contrast to the 1918, 1968, and 2009 pandemics, when seniors were partially protected due to prior childhood exposure to antigenically related viruses .
How was ILI defined? <BM25> From this source of acute-care hospital influenza patients, we defined patients with nosocomial influenza as those admitted to a hospital for a reason other than acute respiratory infection in whom ILI symptoms developed ≥48 h after admission and influenza virus infection was confirmed using RT-PCR.

This network is based on clinical surveillance of acute respiratory infections and laboratory analysis of nasal specimens collected from adults and children by volunteer general practitioners and pediatricians.
What is this network composed of? <BM25> after a given word, and creates a network to match a given word. Word2vec was applied to 7791 news articles composed of 93,326 words that were crawled from CHP.
How are the influenza tests carried out? <BM25> Sensitivity and specificity of the assay. To assess the specificity of the assay, four tests were carried out:
What do 40-50% of the samples test positive for? <BM25> In addition, one sample was positive only for BoHV-5 . Thus, when the test was performed with BoHV-1.1 strains, 4 samples were negative, which were documented as false negatives .
What are the ILI samples wich test negative for influence? <BM25> It is assumed that the ILI consultation data are distributed according to the negative binomial distribution:
What tool has been developed to identify several viruses simultaneously? <BM25> Several biological tools allow identifying respiratory pathogens from nasal swab. In recent years, multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction has been developed to identify several viruses simultaneously . We therefore used this new method to set up a retrospective study using swabs collected by sentinel GPs from 2011 to 2012.
What are the objectives of the study? <BM25> setting activity and study objectives.
On which system the reverse transcription and preamplification steps were performed? <BM25> We used Respifinder 1 Smart 22 kits a multiplex RT-PCR which can detect 22 respiratory pathogens. This assay is based on the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification technology. The reverse transcription and preamplification steps were performed on the epgradient Mastercycler 1 and the hybridization, ligation and detection steps on the LightCycler 1 480 system . This method was chosen because of its high specificity, compared to other same methods . Multiplex analysis allows for rapid production of diagnostic results. It thus allows highlighted the possible presence of eighteen respiratory viruses and four bacteria in one reaction by melt curve analysis: Influenza
Which two seasons were identified for trends in virus circulation?? <BM25> Statistical analyses were performed with Stata 1 and Excel 1 . Two seasons were defined to identify possible seasonal trends in circulation of the viruses: winter season during weeks 23 to 39 between June and September and summer season during the rest of the year.
Which were the most frequently identified respiratory pathogens? <BM25> The respiratory pathogens most frequently identified in ILI swabs were rhinovirus , influenza A not H1N1 and influenza B .

Respiratory viral pathogens were present in what percentage of samples? <BM25> Volunteers were not diagnosed with other pathogens before participation in the study. Since we did not test these samples for other than viral pathogens, we can not exclude the possibility that some of the negative NS are positive for bacteria or other pathogens causing respiratory illness. Recently, one study reported a detection rate of 5% for influenza in EBC . This is in the same range of the detection rate that we report for respiratory viruses in general. Other studies with a limited number of patients, describe a markedly higher sensitivity of 33 to 36% but the higher percentage may
What did the study highlight? <BM25> transcriptomic study . The data shown highlight, once again, the necessity of enriching the databases with bivalve sequences.
How many swabs remained without etiology? <BM25> Among the 148 swabs initially negative for influenza because not previously tested for any other viruses, the study found an etiology for 95 swabs. In total, only 53 swabs, representing 24% of the sample, remained without etiology with negative multiplex PCR results all along the year. Multiple hypotheses can explain this result: a poor quality of swabs, preventing from identifying a pathogen, noninfectious causes or other pathogens not included in the multiplex PCR. However, we couldn't test the negative swabs for RNAse P, a marker of human cells, which could provide a modicum of assurance that the swab contained human
What hypotheses can explain this result? <BM25> considered robust. We can distinguish two main hypotheses that could explain this composition bias.

How many people were affected as of Feb. 10 <BM25> Text: The emergence and outbreak of a newly discovered acute respiratory disease in Wuhan, China, has affected greater than 40,000 people, and killed more than 1,000 as of Feb. 10, 2020. A new human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was quickly identified, and the associated disease is now referred to as coronavirus disease discovered in 2019 .
How is the SARS-CoV-2 referred to? <BM25> mitogen-activated protein kinases and are referred to as "non-canonical" .
How much  similarity the SARS-COV-2 genome sequence has with SARS-COV? <BM25> satellite viruses and satellite RNAs . In contrast to Dls, these dependent RNAs have little or no sequence similarity with the helper virus and do not appear to originate from the helper genome .
what similarity human SARS-COV and palm civet SARSlike COV share? <BM25> Currently, there are speculations, rumours and conspiracy theories that SARS-CoV-2 is of laboratory origin. Some people have alleged that the human SARS-CoV-2 was leaked directly from a laboratory in Wuhan where a bat CoV was recently reported, which shared ∼96% homology with the SARS-CoV-2 . However, as we know, the human SARS-CoV and intermediate host palm civet SARSlike CoV shared 99.8% homology, with a total of 202 single-nucleotide variations identified across the genome . Given that there are greater than 1,100 nt differences between the human SARS-CoV-2 and the bat RaTG13-CoV , which are distributed throughout the genome in a
How much is the difference between the human SARS-CoV-2 and the bat RaTG13-CoV? <BM25> Available TLR8 sequences of other bat species were included in our analyses and compared to the equine and human orthologous.
Why is it highly unlikely that RaTG13 CoV is the immediate source of SARS-CoV-2. <BM25> naturally occurring pattern following the evolutionary characteristics typical of CoVs, it is highly unlikely that RaTG13 CoV is the immediate source of SARS-CoV-2. The absence of a logical targeted pattern in the new viral sequences and a close relative in a wildlife species are the most revealing signs that SARS-CoV-2 evolved by natural evolution. A search for an intermediate animal host between bats and humans is needed to identify animal CoVs more closely related to human SARS-CoV-2. There is speculation that pangolins might carry CoVs closely related to SARS-CoV-2, but the data to substantiate this is not yet published .

What did the Nature Medicine paper report? <BM25> -We would like to publish the paper as Scientific Report (as you indicated This has been done.
Why does the claim lack any scientific  basis? <BM25> Another claim in Chinese social media points to a Nature Medicine paper published in 2015 , which reports the construction of a chimeric CoV with a bat CoV S gene in the backbone of a SARS CoV that has adapted to infect mice and is capable of infecting human cells . However, this claim lacks any scientific basis and must be discounted because of significant divergence in the genetic sequence of this construct with the new SARS-CoV-2 .
How was the mouse-adapted SARS virus (MA15) generated? <BM25> the structure of SARS virus S2 protein 34 as a search probe .
How did  the SARS-CoV gain elevated replication and lung pathogenesis in aged mice ? <BM25> The mouse-adapted SARS virus was generated by serial passage of an infectious wildtype SARS CoV clone in the respiratory tract of BALB/c mice. After 15 passages in mice, the SARS-CoV gained elevated replication and lung pathogenesis in aged mice , due to six coding genetic mutations associated with mouse adaptation. It is likely that MA15 is highly attenuated to replicate in human cells or patients due to the mouse adaptation.
Why is it likely that MA15 is highly attenuated to  replicate in human cells? <BM25> The mouse-adapted SARS virus was generated by serial passage of an infectious wildtype SARS CoV clone in the respiratory tract of BALB/c mice. After 15 passages in mice, the SARS-CoV gained elevated replication and lung pathogenesis in aged mice , due to six coding genetic mutations associated with mouse adaptation. It is likely that MA15 is highly attenuated to replicate in human cells or patients due to the mouse adaptation.
Why were civets proposed to be an intermediate host of the bat-CoVs <BM25> It was proposed that the S gene from bat-derived CoV, unlike that from human patients-or civetsderived viruses, was unable to use human ACE2 as a receptor for entry into human cells . Civets were proposed to be an intermediate host of the bat-CoVs, capable of spreading SARS CoV to humans . However, in 2013 several novel bat coronaviruses were isolated from Chinese horseshoe bats and the bat SARS-like or SL-CoV-WIV1 was able to use ACE2 from humans, civets and Chinese horseshoe bats for entry . Combined with evolutionary evidence that the bat ACE2 gene has been positively selected at the
What was the finding  in 2013? <BM25> this finding .
Why is it proposed that some bat SL-CoVs may be able to directly infect human hosts? <BM25> same contact sites as the human ACE2 gene for interacting with SARS CoV , it was proposed that an intermediate host may not be necessary and that some bat SL-CoVs may be able to directly infect human hosts. To directly address this possibility, the exact S gene from bat coronavirus SL-SHC014 was synthesized and used to generate a chimeric virus in the mouse adapted MA15 SARS-CoV backbone. The resultant SL-SHC014-MA15 virus could indeed efficiently use human ACE2 and replicate in primary human airway cells to similar titres as epidemic strains of SARS-CoV. While SL-SHC014-MA15 can replicate efficiently in young and

What were the results of this test? <BM25> were defined as H. pylori-negative if all test results were negative.
Why were experiments with SL-SHC014-MA15 chimeric virus were later restricted? <BM25> Due to the elevated pathogenic activity of the SHC014-MA15 chimeric virus relative to MA15 chimeric virus with the original human SARS S gene in mice, such experiments with SL-SHC014-MA15 chimeric virus were later restricted as gain of function studies under the US government-mandated pause policy . The current COVID-2019 epidemic has restarted the debate over the risks of constructing such viruses that could have pandemic potential, irrespective of the finding that these bat CoVs already exist in nature. Regardless, upon careful phylogenetic analyses by multiple international groups , the SARS-CoV-2 is undoubtedly distinct from SL-SHC014-MA15, with >6,000 nucleotide differences across
Why is there  no credible evidence to support the claim that the SARS-CoV-2 is derived from the chimeric SL-SHC014-MA15 virus? <BM25> the whole genome. Therefore, once again there is no credible evidence to support the claim that the SARS-CoV-2 is derived from the chimeric SL-SHC014-MA15 virus.
What did the rumour that the virus was made by humans in the lab <BM25> Excursion 2: Metabolic Disease in Lab Mice and Humans -Is Ecological Complexity Better than SPF Facilities?
What was reported in  a rebuttal paper led by an HIV-1 virologist Dr. Feng Gao? <BM25> There are also rumours that the SARS-CoV-2 was artificially, or intentionally, made by humans in the lab, and this is highlighted in one manuscript submitted to BioRxiv , claiming that SARS-CoV-2 has HIV sequence in it and was thus likely generated in the laboratory. In a rebuttal paper led by an HIV-1 virologist Dr. Feng Gao, they used careful bioinformatics analyses to demonstrate that the original claim of multiple HIV insertions into the SARS-CoV-2 is not HIV-1 specific but random . Because of the many concerns raised by the international community, the authors who made the initial claim have already
What happened to the report with initial claims? <BM25> happened if no interventions were implemented (and R, = R0 i.e. the initial reproduction number
What is the difference between evolution and synthetic constructs? <BM25> from anti-ZIKV-Ig and were utilized for the cloning organization of IgG constructs in a novel synthetic dual promoter plasmid strategy for developing anti-ZIKV-IgG.
What is the conclusion of this report? <BM25> A conclusion of this report is the prediction of a slowing of Rt in response to major interventions. To
what is the clinical manifestation similar to? <BM25> of symptom occurrence, mediators and clinical manifestation. This summary is based on ref. 9 .
What was the purpose of the research? <BM25> this perspective, the availability of new markers to asses immune functions is fundamental both for medical care and research purpose .
What preventative measure has been taken to decrease the incidence of diarrhea in children? <BM25> of a cleaning routine that erases much of this inherited microbiome could be a powerful preventative measure against the spread of disease.
What  led to a great increase in their study among virologists worldwide? <BM25> Abstract: The continued emergence and re-emergence of pathogens represent an ongoing, sometimes major, threat to populations. Hantaviruses and their associated human diseases were considered to be confined to Eurasia, but the occurrence of an outbreak in 1993–94 in the southwestern United States led to a great increase in their study among virologists worldwide. Well over 40 hantaviral genotypes have been described, the large majority since 1993, and nearly half of them pathogenic for humans. Hantaviruses cause persistent infections in their reservoir hosts, and in the Americas, human disease is manifest as a cardiopulmonary compromise, hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome , with case-fatality
How many hantaviral genotypes have been described <BM25> 1 is a list of the predominant, serologically distinct pathogenic hantaviruses. Many other named genotypes are described, but such other pathogenic forms are generally closely related to Andes or, in some cases, Sin Nombre virus.
How many of them are pathogenic for humans? <BM25> Vervet monkeys were positive for adventitious agents. As mentioned, many of the viruses which infect primates are pathogenic for humans, the species barrier is being able to be crossed .
What do Hantaviruses cause in their reservoir hosts? <BM25> XSV genomes. Our data indicate that bat-borne hantaviruses and Nova virus, a hantavirus hosted by the European mole, comprise a highly divergent phylogenetic lineage, suggesting that ancestral bats and/or soricomorphs, rather than rodents, may have served as the early reservoir hosts of primordial hantaviruses.
What does hantavirus human disease  manifest as? <BM25> source of VEGF during hantavirus disease pathogenesis.
What is the  case-fatality ratios <BM25> ratios.
What are among the factors that may have increased the human caseload of HCPS between 1993 and the present? <BM25> ratios, for the most common viral serotypes, between 30% and 40%. Habitat disturbance and larger-scale ecological disturbances, perhaps including climate change, are among the factors that may have increased the human caseload of HCPS between 1993 and the present. We consider here the features that influence the structure of host population dynamics that may lead to viral outbreaks, as well as the macromolecular determinants of hantaviruses that have been regarded as having potential contribution to pathogenicity.
What do authors consider  in this study? <BM25> A 3 Å RMSD for redocking a given ligand is quite high . The authors should consider the use of other docking methods, as a comparison.
Which diseases are a major concern among scientists studying infectious diseases? <BM25> Text: Emerging pathogens cause new or previously unrecognized diseases, and among them, emerging zoonotic diseases are a major concern among scientists studying infectious diseases at different spatial and temporal scales . Changes in biotic and abiotic conditions may alter population disease dynamics and lead to the emergence of zoonotic infections . During the last decades, several outbreaks of emerging and re-emerging viral pathogens have occurred, affecting both purely-local and worldwide/pandemic involvement of human populations. Among the conspicuous examples are influenza A, Ebola virus, hepatitis C virus, severe adult respiratory distress , coronavirus, and human immunodeficiency virus, which challenge prevention and

What did <BM25> it. Aiming at this moving target will require out-of-the-box thinking and interdisciplinary collaboration.
Among zoonotic diseases <BM25> human and zoonotic lung diseases.
Which pathogenic RNA viruses are hosted by small mammals? <BM25> pathogenic and zoonotic viruses, the overall risk for astrovirus transmission from bats to humans is assumed to be relatively low and does not, to our current understanding, exceed the risk of an astrovirus transmission from other mammals such as minks, pigs or cattle to humans.
When did Hantavirus infections became a concern in the Americas? <BM25> Hantavirus infections became a concern in the Americas after the description of an outbreak of acute respiratory distress occurred in the Four Corners area in 1993 . The newly recognized disease, hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome, HCPS , was linked to infection by the newly-discovered Sin Nombre virus , and the rodent Peromyscus maniculatus was identified as the reservoir . However, hantavirus infections have a much longer history. A review of ancient Chinese writings, dating back to approximately 960 AD, revealed descriptions closely resembling hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome , the syndrome caused by Old World hantaviruses . During the twentieth century,

How was HFRS  first brought to the attention of western medicine ? <BM25> cases of acute febrile disease with renal compromise were described from several Eurasian countries and Japan, often in association with military engagements . HFRS as a distinct syndrome, however, was first brought to the attention of western medicine in association with an outbreak that occurred among United Nations troops during the Korean conflict between 1951 and 1954, where more than 3,200 soldiers were afflicted . It took more than two decades until the etiologic agent, Hantaan virus , was isolated from the striped field mouse Apodemus agrarius, detected in part by the binding of antibodies from patient serum samples to
What is HTNV? <BM25> HTNV infection in humans.
Where was HTNV isolated from? <BM25> HTNV infection in humans.
Which new genus was the virus later found to represent? <BM25> the lung tissues of healthy, wild-caught field mice . The virus was later found to represent the type species of a new genus Hantavirus of the family Bunyaviridae, although it was later apparent that the first hantavirus to be isolated was the shrew-borne Thottapalayam virus . The categorization of hantaviruses as belonging to the family Bunyaviridae is due in part to the consistent presence of three RNA genomes that are circularized in vivo as a result of the presence of terminal complementary nucleotides that help fold the genome into a -hairpin‖ morphology, first described for the Uukuniemi phlebovirus . Table
Which was  the first hantavirus to be isolated? <BM25> Hantaviruses are lipid-enveloped, tri-segmented, negativesense RNA viruses belonging to the Bunyavirus family. The genus Hantavirus was named for the first virus isolated in 1976 from a striped field mouse near the Hantaan River in South Korea. Unlike other members of the Bunyavirus family that are transmitted to humans by arthropod vectors, hantaviruses are transmitted via inhalation of viruscontaminated aerosols of rodent saliva, urine, and feces.

Table
What was the hairpin morphology first described for? <BM25> Particles measuring 26 to 30 nm with a solid star-shaped pattern on their surface have been termed astroviruses. The surface pattern dif-fers from the hollow Star of David pattern on the 29-to 33-nmdiameter calicivirus. Madeley has described the differential morphology in detail. Astroviruses were first observed in negative staining studies of feces of babies in maternity ward outbreaks of gastroenteritis and in other infants with gastroenteritis .
How is the the precursor form GPC processed <BM25> During virus maturation, the precursor form GPC is processed using a membrane -bound protease into Gn and Gc, a cleavage that occurs, and appears to be signaled, after the conserved peptide signal WAASA at the C-terminal of Gn . Although the two proteins can be expressed independently through transfection, they can be retained in the wrong cellular compartment ; they thus must be co-expressed to allow them stability so that the two can be assembled correctly in the Golgi .
When does the cleavage appear to be signaled? <BM25> effect does not appear to be determined primarily by the sequence at the F protein cleavage site.
Why must the two proteins Gn and Gc be co-expressed? <BM25> separating Gn from Gc .
Which two distinct cellular receptors the glycoproteins are the known or presumed ligands for? <BM25> A number of activities and properties have been identified for the hantavirus envelope glycoproteins, including some features that are suspected to be involved in the pathogenicity of the disease-causing serotypes, a possibility that has engendered experimental attention. The glycoproteins are the known or presumed ligands for at least two distinct cellular receptors, the 3 integrin chain and decay accelerating factor, or DAF ; with gC1qR/p32 also identified as another potential entry receptor . Comparisons with the tick-borne encephalitis virus E protein, led Tischler et al. to consider the Gc glycoprotein as a potential class II fusion protein, perhaps imparting fusion
What is the underlying premise for many of these studies? <BM25> Additional activities have been identified with, or claimed to be related to, Gn. For many of these studies, an underlying premise has held that there are differences between the glycoproteins of -pathogenic‖ hantaviruses relative to viruses in the genus that are dubbed to be -non-pathogenic‖. While it is true that it has not yet been possible to link Prospect Hill virus to human disease, the absence of evidence for its pathogenicity should perhaps not be equated with the evidence of its absence. One might only consider that the level of disease associated with infection of nonhuman primates by PHV is
What is the premise for apathogenic forms to  blunt any pathological response in the host? <BM25> and/or other medications that blunt the host inflammatory response and dampen the cytokine cascade .
Which proteins and mRNAs prominently induced by hantaviruses include? <BM25> be quickly cleared or rendered less competent in its replication so as to blunt any pathological response in the host . The anti-hantavirus innate response can in some cases be attributed to viral interaction as a ligand of TLR-3, but not in others, and in endothelial cells, it appears not to require more than the viral particle itself, even when introduced in replication-incompetent form . Proteins and mRNAs prominently induced by hantaviruses include MxA and IFIT-1 and others including some with known or suspected anti-viral activity. Those hantaviruses, often highly pathogenic strains, that fail to induce a potent antiviral response,
What have hantaviruses been identified as adversely affect? <BM25> have examined the activities of hantavirus glycoproteins and other proteins that might themselves directly affect some aspects of the pathogenic progression associated with hantavirus infection of humans, such as vascular permeability changes. While early attempts to directly cause increases in permeability of endothelial monolayers with viral particles or viral infection were largely disappointing, hantaviruses have been identified as adversely affecting endothelial migration over substrata and in potentiating VEG-F-induced endothelial permeability .
What have hantaviruses been identified in potentiating? <BM25> have examined the activities of hantavirus glycoproteins and other proteins that might themselves directly affect some aspects of the pathogenic progression associated with hantavirus infection of humans, such as vascular permeability changes.

What does the N-protein <BM25> it. Aiming at this moving target will require out-of-the-box thinking and interdisciplinary collaboration.
As an RNA-binding protein that engages the hairpin termini of the genomic segments <BM25> The shorter nucleocapsid or N protein is a structural component of the viral nucleocapsid, along with the genomic viral RNA segments. As an RNA-binding protein that engages the hairpin termini of the genomic segments with high affinity , it limits the access of the RNA to host nucleases and helps to render viral replication a closed process within the cytoplasm. It also acts as a peripheral membrane protein, as does the L protein , an activity that could play a role in its presumed, but not yet demonstrated function as matrix . Until recently, it had not been appreciated that
What does the N-protein act as? <BM25> Act.
What can  some of the other activities of N have <BM25> activities for 2017.
What is  N  also reported to interact with? <BM25> We reported above that a number of proteins encoded by viral overlapping genes interact. Interestingly, as has been recently noted , some of the proteins encoded by these mammalian overlaps also interact and ATXN1 interacts with Alt-ATXN1 ).
How do the viral RNAs become concentrated in P bodies during hantavirus infection? <BM25> inflammatory responses mediated by NF kappa B . The effects on NF-B expression appeared to be confined to prevention of its nuclear translocation after its attempted activation with lipopolysaccharide, LPS . In the cytoplasm of infected cells, N protein can be found in cellular P bodies where it sequesters and protects 5' caps. It may locate the caps through its interaction with DCP1, a key constituent of P bodies. During hantavirus infection, the viral RNAs become concentrated in P bodies, through their interaction with N and DCP1. The N protein demonstrates preferential protection of mRNAs engineered to prematurely terminate their
What have confocal microscopy and biochemical-inhibitor studies shown? <BM25> -Multifunctional -Can bind to both DNA and RNA G4s -G4 visualization in live cells using the multi-photon microscopy -Allows both RNA and DNA G4 imaging using confocal microscopy -No binding competition with other G4 ligands shown
What have confocal microscopy and biochemical-inhibitor studies shown on what N tracks? <BM25> Trafficking of N for viral assembly: Classically, N protein in infected cells appears to be clustered or particulate in nature, with a heavy concentration at a single perinuclear location, widely considered to be the Golgi . The N proteins of hantaviruses are found in association with particulate fractions, and confocal microscopy and biochemical-inhibitor studies have shown that N tracks along microtubules but not with actin filaments . The ultimate destination for N, for its assembly into viral particles is the Golgi, and it traffics there via the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate complex , also known as vesicular-tubular cluster . A dominant
What is the ultimate destination for N <BM25> Trafficking of N for viral assembly: Classically, N protein in infected cells appears to be clustered or particulate in nature, with a heavy concentration at a single perinuclear location, widely considered to be the Golgi .

A dominant
How does it traffic? <BM25> the blood, where they traffic to the brain.
What is a dominant negative inhibitor? <BM25> inhibitor MLN-4760 was used as negative control.
What is dynamitin associated with? <BM25> negative inhibitor, dynamitin, associated with dynein-mediated transport, reduced N's accumulation in the Golgi. Later studies suggested that the specific dependence on microtubular transport is specific to Old World hantaviruses such as HTNV, but that the New World hantavirus ANDV is instead associated with actin filaments . However, recent data indicates that microtubular transport is indeed utilized for the New World hantavirus SNV .
What does recent data indicate? <BM25> new ventures, indicating an unwillingness or inability to care for patients in the face of risk. Recent survey data from the U.S. indicate that there exists mixed views on the duty to care for patients during infectious disease outbreaks .
Why have Hantavirus diseases of man been suspected of having an immunopathogenic basis? <BM25> Hantavirus diseases of man have long been suspected of having an immunopathogenic basis in part because of their relatively long incubation period of 2-3 weeks and the observed temporal association between immunologic derangements and the first appearance of signs and symptoms of hantavirus illness. HFRS and HCPS share many clinical features, leading many investigators to consider them to be, in essence, different manifestations of a similar pathogenic process, differing mainly in the primary target organs of disease expression . The pathogenesis of hantavirus infections is the topic of a continuously-updated review in the series UpToDate .
What is a critical feature of both? <BM25> relatively nonimmunogenic. Because infrequent dosing may be very important for patient compliance for a parenterally delivered protein-based therapeutic that is directed at chronic indications such as osteoporosis, low immunogenicity could be a critical feature for the success of this product.
What is the character of he resulting leakage? <BM25> in HCPS. The resulting leakage is exudative in character, with chemical composition high in protein and resembling plasma.
Which is an especially attractive candidate as an important in vivo receptor for hantaviruses? <BM25> The continued experience indicating the strong tissue tropism for endothelial cells, specifically, is among the several factors that make β3 integrin an especially attractive candidate as an important in vivo receptor for hantaviruses. It is likely that hantaviruses arrive at their target tissues through uptake by regional lymph nodes, perhaps with or within an escorting lung histiocyte. The virus seeds local endothelium, where the first few infected cells give rise, ultimately, to a primary viremia, a process that appears to take a long time for hantavirus infections . By the time that secondary viremia emerges, the agents of the more
What  is the likely way that hantaviruses arrive at their target tissues? <BM25> virus could arrive at these sites, whereas in the orally-inoculated group direct contact with target tissues cannot be ruled out.
What does the virus seed? <BM25> of the seed is shown.
What happens with the viral seeding at the  local endothelium? <BM25> Finally, there is the prognosis for local recurrence by seeding of disseminated cells after apparently complete tumor ablation .
How long does the process of giving rise to primary viremia for hantavirus infections? <BM25> The continued experience indicating the strong tissue tropism for endothelial cells, specifically, is among the several factors that make β3 integrin an especially attractive candidate as an important in vivo receptor for hantaviruses.

How is the  the expression of proinflammatory cytokines induced? <BM25> TLR4 is constitutively expressed in AMφ, and TLR2 can be induced in response to LPS or proinflammatory cytokines. The inducible TLR2 expression might be important in responding to other bacterial components from Grampositive bacteria .

What happens for HFRS? <BM25> HFRS .
What is considered to be  a requirement for the development of systemic disease symptoms? <BM25> Local elaboration of inflammatory and chemotactic mediators is considered to be a requirement for the development of systemic disease symptoms, with those abnormalities sometimes culminating in shock and death. Yet it is not hypoxemia, due to the prominent pulmonary edema, that leads to death in most fatal cases of HCPS, but rather intoxication of the heart by as-yet-undefined mediators that leads to the low cardiac output state and the associated shock syndrome . It is tempting to speculate that mediators produced in the lung in connection with the inflammatory infiltrate can percolate through the coronary circulation with minimal dilution in
What do those abnormalities sometimes culminate in? <BM25> viral lytic antigens, this does not appear to cause enhanced cell death, nor does it culminate in higher viral titers.

What potential mechanism <BM25> to validate their mechanism of action, and to demonstrate their suitability as potential candidate therapeutics.
What  explanation have some investigators favored   for much of the capillary leak? <BM25> Direct viral effects. The observed correlation between viral load and disease severity leaves the possibility open that hantavirus particles or RNA can themselves have toxic effects on cells or on signaling. Some investigators have favored direct viral toxicity, acting through the inhibition of endothelial cell barrier function, as an explanation for much of the capillary leak, although there is widespread agreement that multiple mechanisms that mediate pathogenesis likely operate simultaneously in the affected patient . A potentially important clue toward the mechanism by which hantavirus infections deplete blood platelets and, in some cases cause hemorrhagic manifestations, was advanced by
What animal models exist for both the asymptomatic carriage of PUUV and SNV? <BM25> Testing models of pathogenesis can be done more effectively when there is an animal model that mimics key aspects of the disease. There is no such model that closely mimics HFRS, but animal models exist for both the asymptomatic carriage of PUUV and SNV by their native carrier rodents, the bank vole Myodes glareolus and the deer mouse P. maniculatus; as well as a Syrian hamster model using ANDV or the related Maporal virus from Venezuela, for which an HCPS-mimetic disease is observed .
For what can the Syrian hamster model used? <BM25> Syrian hamster transcriptome sequences were aligned to transcriptome references using BLAST . An Expect value cutoff parameter of 10 was used and alignments results were filtered in order to only keep sequences aligned at least at 80%.
What does the hamster model for HCPS caused by? <BM25> The ANDV-Syrian hamster model has a number of features in common with the human disease, as well as some differences. Unlike the neurologic diseases that have been possible to elicit with HTNV, the hamster model for HCPS appears to be caused by capillary leak that results in pulmonary edema and the production of a pleural effusion with exudative characteristics. Typically the hamsters die between 11 and 14-d post-inoculation, reflecting a slightly accelerated incubation period in comparison to human infections. As with human HCPS, the microscopic examination of the lung reveals abundant fibrin deposition, thickened alveolar septa, and viral antigen expressed
Typically how long do the hamsters die post-inoculation? <BM25> receive as long as ventilators are available, otherwise these cases would die.
What does the microscopic examination of the lung reveal <BM25> bibasal lung crepitations, in the absence of other features. Abdominal examination failed to reveal clinically significant findings.
What do ANDV-infected hamsters fitted with physiologic monitoring devices exhibit? <BM25> abundantly in the microvascular endothelium. ANDV-infected hamsters fitted with physiologic monitoring devices exhibited diminished pulse pressures, tachycardia, and hypotension that appear to closely mimic the shock that is believed to be the proximate cause of demise in patients who succumb to HCPS .
What do diminished pulse pressures <BM25> abundantly in the microvascular endothelium.

Compared to  humans <BM25> PaCO 2 for the mouse, e.g., compared to mammals ranging from rats to humans .
With what have three studies correlated  plasma viral RNA? <BM25> Viral RNA quantities were positively correlated with the concentrations of IP-10 and TNF-α at both 24 and 72 h p.i. . Notably, the concentrations of IL-6, which were previously reported to be increased in the plasma of H7N9-infected patients during the first week p.i. , were not significantly associated with viral RNA quantities using this primary culture model.
What are examples of delivery vectors for commercial anti-Salmonella vaccines? <BM25> for edible vaccines using both human and commercial animal examples, including vaccines against enterotoxigenic strains of Escherichia coli and swine transmissible gastroenteritis virus .
What can be a factor in using common vectors for the delivery of vaccines? <BM25> Various adjuvants and delivery systems have been developed for improving vaccine efficacy. Clinical trials for Spz-stage anti-malarial vaccines have involved using adjuvants consisting of a combination of immunostimulants and viral vectors. The AS01 adjuvant has been used in RTS/S, consisting of a combination of immunostimulants, monophosphoryl lipid A in a liposome formulation and Quillaja saponaria fraction 21 in water-in-oil emulsion .
Is a pre-existing immune response to commonly used delivery vector an advantage or a disadvantage? <BM25> As pointed out in the previous section, one of the major limitations of using viral vectors is the undesirable, and occasionally toxic, immune response to the vectors which makes multiple applications difficult. The advantage of using non-viral vectors over their viral counterparts lies in their cost effectiveness, commercial availability and lack of immunogenicity. However, their major disadvantage has been the low transfection efficiency in vivo compared with the viral vectors. Cationic liposomes and cationic polymers are two of the most widely used non-viral vectors for gene delivery.
What bacterial delivery vectors have been tested in animal hosts? <BM25> Text: In the fields of medicine and veterinary medicine, there are numerous live, attenuated bacterial and viral vaccines in use today worldwide. The safety and efficacy of such vaccines is well established and allows further development as vector systems to deliver antigen originating from other pathogens. Various attenuated bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae, lactic acid bacteria , specifically Lactococcus lactis, Mycobacterium, Listeria, Shigella and Salmonella, have been tested for the targeted delivery of heterologous antigens of bacterial, viral and parasitic origin into a variety of animal hosts . Bacteria such as E. coli and lactic acid bacteria have recently
Which bacteial delivery vectors have gained favor for vaccines? <BM25> Various adjuvants and delivery systems have been developed for improving vaccine efficacy. Clinical trials for Spz-stage anti-malarial vaccines have involved using adjuvants consisting of a combination of immunostimulants and viral vectors. The AS01 adjuvant has been used in RTS/S, consisting of a combination of immunostimulants, monophosphoryl lipid A in a liposome formulation and Quillaja saponaria fraction 21 in water-in-oil emulsion .
Why are E Coli and lactic acid are safe choices as delivery vectors for vaccines? <BM25> Recently, lactic acid bacteria presenting influenza virus antigens have been studied . For mucosal immunization, LAB is a more attractive delivery system than other live vaccine vectors, such as Shigella, Salmonella, and Listeria . It is considered safe and exhibits an adjuvant-like effect on mucosal and systemic immunity .

What are filamentous bacteriophages genera Inovirua and Plectrovirus? <BM25> Long before the identification of filamentous phage, other types of bacteriophage were already being used for antibacterial therapy in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe . The filamentous phage, with its nonlytic life cycle, has less obvious clinical uses, despite the fact that the host specificity of Inovirus and Plectrovirus includes many pathogens of medical importance, including Salmonella, E. coli, Shigella, Pseudomonas, Clostridium, and Mycoplasma species.
What invention has made bacteriophage useful for research? <BM25> by impactors . Due to these problems, the Andersen sampler often underestimates the biological aerosol load. Unfortunately, no relevant improvements have been made in Andersen type samplers for bioaerosol sampling since its invention.
What has the bacteriphage technology and the library of folded protein variants enabled? <BM25> Selection begins with generation of a large RNA library with fixed 5' and 3' ends and a degenerated region of 30-60 nucleotides in length . Such library contains 10 14 -10 15 variants of RNA molecules, which are folded in complex 3D structure. The library is incubated with a protein and RNA molecules bound to the protein target are separated from unbound RNA molecules. The bound RNA molecules are separated from proteins and then amplified by means of reverse transcriptase and PCR to obtain a new pool of mole cules with increased affinity. The procedure is usually repeated 10-15 times

Common themes shared amongst all these applications include the unique biological, immunological, and physicochemical properties of the phage, its ability to display a variety of biomolecules in modular fashion, and its relative simplicity and ease of manipulation.
What do applications of filamentous phage depend on? <BM25> Nearly all applications of the filamentous phage depend on its ability to display polypeptides on the virion's surface as fusions to phage coat proteins . The display mode determines the maximum tolerated size of the fused polypeptide, its copy number on the phage, and potentially, the structure of the displayed polypeptide. Display may be achieved by fusing DNA encoding a polypeptide of interest directly to the gene encoding a coat protein within the phage genome , resulting in fully recombinant phage. Much more commonly, however, only one copy of the coat protein is modified in the presence of a second,
What characteristics are determined by the display  mode? <BM25> • The mode of action which depicts steps and processes to molecular and functional effects is determined.
How may the display be achieved? <BM25> technology has achieved a number of successes: workable vaccines based on fimbrial display are now in the last stages of testing or have already been commercialized, and the ability to display random libraries by fimbriae seems promising for a wide range of applications.
What does  the term "phage display" refer to? <BM25> used coat proteins for display are the major coat protein, pVIII, and the minor coat protein, pIII, with the major advantage of the former being higher copy number display , and of the latter being the ability to display some folded proteins at an appreciable copy number . While pVIII display of folded proteins on hybrid phage is possible, it typically results in a copy number of much less than 1 per virion . For the purposes of this review, we use the term "phage display" to refer to a recombinant filamentous phage displaying a single polypeptide sequence on its
What does the term "phage displayed library" refer to? <BM25> surface , and the term "phage-displayed library" to refer to a diverse pool of recombinant filamentous phage displaying an array of polypeptide variants . Such libraries are typically screened by iterative cycles of panning against an immobilized protein of interest followed by amplification of the bound phage in E. coli cells.
What characteristic of filamentous phage has been demonstrated? <BM25> multiple groups over the past 50 years has contributed to a relatively sophisticated understanding of filamentous phage structure, biology and life cycle .
What application is a natural extension of the  ability to display recombinant exogenous sequences on its surface? <BM25> Early work with anti-phage antisera generated for species classification purposes demonstrated that the filamentous phage virion is highly immunogenic in the absence of adjuvants and that only the major coat protein, pVIII, and the minor coat protein, pIII, are targeted by antibodies . Thus, the idea of using the phage as carrier to elicit antibodies against poorly immunogenic haptens or polypeptide was a natural extension of the ability to display recombinant exogenous sequences on its surface, which was first demonstrated by de la Cruz et al. . The phage particle's low cost of production, high stability and potential for high
What makes it an attractive vaccine carrier? <BM25> both cellular and humoral immune responses makes them an attractive option as vaccine vectors.
What does the display mode determine? <BM25> of investigation needed to determine the exact mode of transmission for most of the recently identified diseases.

Several strategies for phage-based contraceptive vaccines have been proposed for control of animal populations. For example, immunization with phage displaying follicle-stimulating hormone peptides on pVIII elicited antibodies that impaired the fertility of mice and ewes . Phage displaying or chemically Rubinchik and Chow conjugated to sperm antigen peptides or peptide mimics and gonadotropin-releasing hormone are also in development.
Which are some phage based contraceptive vaccines for animals? <BM25> an anti-IgE antibody elicited antibodies that bound purified IgE molecules , which may be useful in allergy immunotherapy. Several strategies for phage-based contraceptive vaccines have been proposed for control of animal populations. For example, immunization with phage displaying follicle-stimulating hormone peptides on pVIII elicited antibodies that impaired the fertility of mice and ewes . Phage displaying or chemically Rubinchik and Chow conjugated to sperm antigen peptides or peptide mimics and gonadotropin-releasing hormone are also in development.
What is one reason for the lack of success of immunization phage displayed peptides with native protein? <BM25> it has been extremely difficult to elicit antibody responses that cross-react with native protein epitopes using peptides. The overall picture is considerably bleaker than that painted by Table 2 , since in several studies either: peptide ligands selected from phage-displayed libraries were classified by the authors as mimics of discontinuous epitopes if they bore no obvious sequence homology to the native protein, which is weak evidence of non-linearity, or the evidence for cross-reactivity of antibodies elicited by immunization with phage-displayed peptides with native protein was uncompelling. Irving et al. describe at least one reason for this lack of success: it
Despite shortcomings <BM25> Despite the shortcomings of current molecular identification systems, there is a strong stimulus for the continued use of ITS polymorphisms to generate identification barcodes. Therefore, the RCA-based assay is an alternative to DNA sequencing for species identification.
What is the result of all species tests of phage particles? <BM25> 4. As long as no contamination is introduced, phage particles can be stored in a culture medium at 4 °C for many years.
What are the results of filamentous phage immunizations in mice? <BM25> compared the effect of administration route on filamentous phage immunogenicity. Antibodies are generated against only three major sites on the virion: the surface-exposed N-terminal ∼12 residues of the pVIII monomer lattice ; the N-terminal N1 and N2 domains of pIII ; and bacterial lipopolysaccharide embedded in the phage coat . In mice, serum antibody titers against the phage typically reach 1:10 5 -1:10 6 after 2-3 immunizations, and are maintained for at least 1 year postimmunization . Primary antibody responses against the phage appear to be composed of a mixture of IgM and IgG2b isotypes in C57BL/6 mice, while secondary

On what does the antibody  response to phage depend on? <BM25> made phage display the gold standard for antibody drug discovery.
What do biodistribution studies of the phage after intravenous injection show? <BM25> The phage particle is self-adjuvanting through multiple mechanisms. Host cell wall-derived LPS enhances the virion's immunogenicity, and its removal by polymyxin B chromatography reduces antibody titers against phage coat proteins . The phage's singlestranded DNA genome contains CpG motifs and may also have an adjuvant effect. The antibody response against the phage is entirely dependent on MyD88 signaling and is modulated by stimulation of several Toll-like receptors , indicating that innate immunity plays an important but largely uncharacterized role in the activation of anti-phage adaptive immune responses. Biodistribution studies of the phage after intravenous injection show that it is cleared

What were more potent inhibitors of Staphylococcus aureus growth than high-concentration free chloramphenicol? <BM25> More advanced therapeutic applications of the filamentous phage emerge when it is modified to express a targeting moiety specific for pathogenic cells and/or proteins for the treatment of infectious diseases, cancer and autoimmunity . The first work in this area showed as proof-of-concept that phage encoding a GFP expression cassette and displaying a HER2specific scFv on all copies of pIII were internalized into breast tumor cells, resulting in GFP expression . M13 or fd phage displaying either a targeting peptide or antibody fragment and tethered to chloramphenicol by a labile crosslinker were more potent inhibitors of Staphylococcus aureus growth than

As a virus-like particle, the filamentous phage engages multiple arms of the immune system, beginning with cellular effectors of innate immunity , which are recruited to tumor sites by phage displaying tumor-targeting moieties. The phage likely
Why is the phage displaying  an scFv against β-amyloid fibrils  is a good diagnostic for Alzheimers and Parkinson's disease? <BM25> a diagnostic and therapeutic reagent for Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease due to the unanticipated ability of the phage to penetrate into brain tissue . Similarly, phage displaying an immunodominant peptide epitope derived from myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein depleted pathogenic demyelinating antibodies in brain tissue in the murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model of multiple sclerosis . The advantages of the filamentous phage in this context over traditional antibody-drug or protein-peptide conjugates are its ability to carry very high amounts of drug or peptide, and its ability to access anatomical compartments that cannot generally be reached by systemic administration of a protein.
What is the structure of a filamentous phage particle? <BM25> by multiple groups over the past 50 years has contributed to a relatively sophisticated understanding of filamentous phage structure, biology and life cycle .
What makes filamentous phage ideal scaffold for bioconjugation? <BM25> The filamentous phage particle is enclosed by a rod-like protein capsid, ∼1000 nm long and 5 nm wide, made up almost entirely of overlapping pVIII monomers, each of which lies ∼27 angstroms from its nearest neighbor and exposes two amine groups as well as at least three carboxyl groups . The regularity of the phage pVIII lattice and its diversity of chemically addressable groups make it an ideal scaffold for bioconjugation . The most commonly used approach is functionalization of amine groups with NHS esters , although this can result in unwanted acylation of pIII and any displayed biomolecules. Carboxyl
What trials have been done to demonstrate the potential of phage in applications for nanomaterials? <BM25> Taking into account the advances in vaccine development, VLPs have a positive reputation as systems of academic, industrial, and commercial significance and are no longer only ''mere laboratory curiosities'' . However, in some fields, such as gene therapy and nanomaterials, the potential VLP application technologies are based only on laboratory experiments.

What was the range of genomic sequencing depths? <BM25> sequencing depths were higher for PEDV than for RVA . High sequencing depths were acquired after three hours of sequencing for PEDV and for most RVA gene segments .
Which q-score reads were eliminated from the analysis? <BM25> was compared with the remaining reads, such that reads containing these primer/adaptor sequences were eliminated; reads of less than a given length were removed; homopolymer-containing reads were trimmed and duplicated reads were identified and removed.
What was the mean length of the sequenced read? <BM25> As some of the fragments in the libraries were shorter than 100 bp, the 3 0 adapters were sequenced in part or full in some of the reads. Therefore raw reads were first trimmed using the cutadapt program . Trimmed reads were mapped to the D. melanogaster reference transcriptome and expression levels of genes and isoforms were estimated following the RNA-Seq by Expectation-Maximization pipeline version 1.2.8 . The reference transcriptome was constructed with the D. melanogaster reference genome version 5.54 and the Ensembl annotation version 5.74. The mean and standard deviation of read length in each library was calculated using

What is sporulation? <BM25> studies have been conducted to assess the process and morphology of sporulation .
What is the key regulator to sporulation? <BM25> Spo0A is the key regulator for sporulation . Most of our knowledge about the protein is based on work in Bacilli. Spo0A is a response regulator that demonstrates phosphorylation dependent binding to DNA . Phosphorylation occurs through the concerted action of several proteins that together form a so called phosphorelay . The signaling cascade allows for the integration of environmental signals into the regulation of Spo0A dependent processes, including sporulation. The two functional domains, the N-terminal phosphorylation and dimerization domain , and the C-terminal DNA binding domain are separated by a hinge region that is relatively poorly conserved . Phosphorylation

What activates the UPR pathway in the cell? <BM25> investigated whether PFT-mediated activation of the UPR and the p38 MAPK pathway might be connected.
What indicators does the UPR pathway use to regulate protein folding and secretion in the cell? <BM25> The RNA-Seq and pathway analysis data indicated that UPR and stress response genes were induced after VEEV infection. During an infection, host cells respond to cellular stresses resulting from increased viral protein translation and secretion by triggering the onset of the UPR pathway. The UPR pathway is an adaptive cellular response activated by endoplasmic reticulum stress due to protein misfolding. In order to regulate cellular homeostasis during protein folding and secretion, the UPR pathway has developed three classes of sensors to ensure proper cellular regulation: inositolrequiring enzyme 1 , protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase , and activating transcription factor 6

How do SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV evade the immune system sensing it's genome? <BM25> Both viral infections elicit a very strong inflammatory response, and are also able to circumvent the immune response. There appears to be several ways that these viruses evade and otherwise redirect the immune response . The pathways that lead to the induction of the antiviral type I interferon response are common targets of many viruses, and coronaviruses are no exception. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are contained in double membrane vesicles , that prevents sensing of its genome . As with most coronaviruses several viral proteins suppress the type I IFN response, and other aspects of innate antiviral immunity . These alterations
What role does initial viral titer play in the prognosis of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV? <BM25> of the type I IFN response appear to play a role in immunopathology in more than one way. In patients with high initial viral titers there is a poor prognosis . This indicates that reduction of the antiviral response may lead to direct viral-induced pathology. There is also evidence that the delayed type I IFN response can lead to misregulation of the immune response that can cause immunopathology. In a mouse model of SARS-CoV infection, the type I IFN response is delayed . The delay of this potent antiviral response leads to decreased viral clearance, at the same time there
What is the timeline of the type I interferon (IFN) response in SARS-CoV infection? <BM25> These results indicate that the interferon antiviral response to influenza virus infection is at least partially regulated by H3K79 methylation via canonical type I IFN signaling mediated by the STAT pathway at the level of IFN activation and response.

What is the role of interferon's (IFNs) in the treatment of SARS-CoV? <BM25> Type I interferon in HIV treatment: from antiviral drug to therapeutic target The term 'interferon' was coined by Alick Isaacs and Jean Lindenmann in 1957 to describe the soluble factor responsible for interfering with the growth of influenza virus in vitro . Different types of interferons have been identified and, with the exception of IFN-g , are referred to as type I IFNs . IFN-a , IFN-b, -e, -k, -w and -u are the six species of type I IFN found in humans. In this review, the term 'type I IFN' will be used to describe IFN-a and IFN-b, the
What are some negative effects of decreasing immunopathology by immunomodulation? <BM25> response and prevent excessive inflammation . However, decreasing immunopathology by immunomodulation is problematic because it can lead to increased pathogen burden, and thus increase virus-induced pathology . Another potential treatment option is increasing tissue repair pathways to increase host resilience to disease. This has been shown by bioinformatics , as well as in several animal models . These therapies have been shown in cell culture model systems or animal models to be effective, but have not been demonstrated in human patients. The correct timing of the treatments is essential. Early intervention has been shown to be the most effective in
What is the role of topoisomerase I in improving host resilience in viral lung infections? <BM25> Corticosteroids are broadly immunosuppressive and have many physiological effects .

What  type of virus is 2019-nCOV? <BM25> type virus infection.
What clade does it belong to? <BM25> A substantial fraction of sequences do not belong in any significant clade, and some sequences could belong to multiple clades, depending on the phylogenetic tree method used , therefore, we found Q s and S s for each strain by comparing that strain to all other sequences within the time window.
What other betacoronaviruses are zoonotic in origin? <BM25> The 2019 novel coronavirus , a betacoronavirus, forms a clade within the subgenus sarbecovirus of the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily . The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus are also betacoronaviruses that are zoonotic in origin and have been linked to potential fatal illness during the outbreaks in 2003 and 2012, respectively . Based on current evidence, pathogenicity for 2019-nCoV is about 3%, which is significantly lower than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV . However, 2019-nCoV has potentially higher transmissibility than both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV .

Nucleic amplification tests are usually preferred as in the case of MERS-CoV diagnosis as it has the highest sensitivity at the earliest time point in the acute phase of infection . Chinese health authorities have recently posted the full genome of 2019-nCoV in the GenBank and in GISAID portal to facilitate in the detection of the virus . Several laboratory assays have been developed to detect the novel
Why are Nucleic amplification tests (NAAT) usually preferred as in the case of MERS-CoV diagnosis? <BM25> infection or infant diagnosis, nucleic acid amplification tests are preferred, as HIV-1 RNA can be detected as early as 10-12 days post infection and HIV-1 DNA and/or RNA are definitive indicators of active infection . In their current form, however, NAAT's are not feasible for POC testing, because they are timeconsuming, expensive, and technically complicated. To date, the Aptima HIV-1 RNA assay is the only FDA-approved NAAT for the diagnosis or confirmation of HIV-1 infection and it is only suitable for laboratory testing.
Where  was the first validated diagnostic test designed? <BM25> The first validated diagnostic test was designed in Germany. Corman et al. had initially designed a candidate diagnostic RT-PCR assay based on the SARS or SARS-related coronavirus as it was suggested that circulating virus was SARS-like.

Why is matrix protein 2 (M2) an attractive target for a universal influenza vaccine? <BM25> Matrix protein 2 is highly conserved among influenza A virus strains, indicating that M2 is an attractive target for developing a universal vaccine . In previous studies, various constructs of the M2 vaccine have been developed and tested, including recombinant Escherichia coli expressing M2 fusion protein, adenoviral vectors expressing the M2 protein, plasmid DNA encoding M2 and peptides encoding M2e , each of which was able to elicit protective immune responses in mice. However, the drawback of these M2-based vaccines is their low immunogenicity; additionally, most of them would require intramuscular injections. Therefore, many strategies have been applied focusing on

What regulates the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines? <BM25> Abstract: Nod-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing 3 regulates the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 1 beta and IL-18. We previously showed that influenza virus M2 or encephalomyocarditis virus 2B proteins stimulate IL-1β secretion following activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. However, the mechanism by which severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus activates the NLRP3 inflammasome remains unknown. Here, we provide direct evidence that SARS-CoV 3a protein activates the NLRP3 inflammasome in lipopolysaccharide-primed macrophages. SARS-CoV 3a was sufficient to cause the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The ion channel activity of the 3a protein was essential for 3a-mediated IL-1β secretion. While cells uninfected or infected
Where does the NLRP3 inflammasome activate after a SARS-CoV infection? <BM25> Bacteria carry an array of PAMPs, some of which are delivered into the host cytoplasm, where they activate the inflammasome .

As per the ELSO database and Indian epidemiology, the most important microbes grown from the blood include CoNS, Acinetobacter, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas, Staph aureus, and Candida; hence, the empiric therapy can be directed to these organisms.
What protein is in the critical path of immunity and cytokine expression? <BM25> Innate immune response protects the host from MTB infection by secretion of cytokines including TNF-α in immune cells. Meanwhile, MAPK is one of the critical proteins in the regulation of immunity and cytokine expression. Since MAPK is regulated by MKP-1 in response to LPS and the activation of MAPK is important in BCGinduced cytokine expression, we hypothesize that MKP-1 plays a critical role in the immune regulation of BCG in human monocytes. We examined the involvement of MKP-1 in BCG-induced MAPK activation and its consequent cytokine expression. Here, we present evidences that MKP-1 plays an unexpected role in the regulation

What does the LAIV contain? <BM25> protective efficacy of LAIV in 1-day-old chickens.
Do LAIV replicate at body temperature? <BM25> in humans . Currently, NA-specific antibody responses are not considered a correlate of protection . LAIV is administered as a nasal spray and contains the same three or four influenza virus strains as inactivated vaccines but on an attenuated vaccine backbone . LAIV are temperature-sensitive and cold-adapted so they do not replicate effectively at core body temperature, but replicate in the mucosa of the nasopharynx . LAIV immunization induces serum antibody responses, mucosal antibody responses , and T cell responses. While robust serum antibody and nasal wash antibody responses are associated with protection from infection, other immune responses, such as
What is a characteristic of LAIV? <BM25> protective efficacy of LAIV in 1-day-old chickens.
Where do the LAIV replicate? <BM25> the choice of a viral backbone of cold-adapted viruses and are therefore temperature-sensitive and replicate only locally after administration at the mucosa of the nasopharynx. 2 In addition to serum antibodies, immunization with LAIV also induces mucosal antibodies and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes .

In Study 2, our focus was on vaccination schedule consisting of priming with LAIV at 1 day of age and boosting with IIV at 3 weeks of age . This regimen was compared with other prime-boost regimens or single vaccinations in terms of antibody response and heterologous protection efficacy . Serum HI antibody responses induced by different vaccination schedules. Fig 5 shows HI antibody responses at 4 and 5 weeks of age. Seroconversion of birds vaccinated at 1 day of age was age-dependent and reached 100% for homologous viral antigen in 5-week-old chickens . However, the
Why LAIV may provide broader broader  protection than TIV? <BM25> induce broader protection than TIV due to the diversity of the immune response consistent with inducing virus-neutralizing serum and mucosal antibodies, as well as broadly reactive T cell responses . While overall both TIV and LAIV are considered safe and effective, there is a recognized need for improved seasonal influenza vaccines . Moreover, improved understanding of immunity to conserved influenza virus antigens has raised the possibility of a universal vaccine, and these universal antigens will likely require novel vaccines for effective delivery .

What is the advantage of recombinant DNA system? <BM25> Another problem might be that expression of the foreign protein is incompatible with vaccinia replication or assembly. We have had this problem with several proteins that accumulate in the intermediate compartment and cis-Golgi network. Either the recombinant is never obtained, or DNA encoding the foreign gene is lost, giving the virus a growth advantage over virus that still contains the foreign gene. In this case, one alternative is to use adouble infection system . The cDNA encoding the foreign gene is cloned into a recombination vector with the T7 RNA promoter instead of the P,,s promoter , and a recombinant

Importantly, the latter two delivery methods induce robust mucosal immune responses and may bypass preexisting vector immunity . Even replication-defective adenovirus vectors are naturally immunostimulatory and effective adjuvants to the recombinant antigen being delivered. Adenovirus has been extensively studied as a vaccine vector for human disease. The first report using adenovirus as a vaccine vector for influenza demonstrated immunogenicity of recombinant adenovirus 5 expressing the HA of a swine influenza virus, A/Swine/Iowa/1999 . Intramuscular immunization of

What was the failure of rAd5 vaccine for inducing HIV-1 specific T cell response? <BM25> was capable of inducing a robust cellular immune response in mice . Conversely, a study conducted by Loeffler et al. revealed that L. monocytogenes induced a better immune response, when delivering recombinant antigen protein, than plasmid DNA. Antigens expressed by L. monocytogenes significantly increased the CD8+ T cell response, whereas the DNA vaccine carried by L. monocytogenes failed to induce a specific T cell response .

What is the advantage of inclusion of non-HA antigens to HA based vaccines? <BM25> recombinant subunit vaccines, vector based vaccines , and a universal vaccine based on highly conservative antigens .
What is the disadvantage of inclusion of non-HA  antigens to HA based vaccines? <BM25> In some research works, adenovirus vectors are used for the expression of individual viral antigens and, in particular, HA of influenza viruses. A serious disadvantage for these vectors is the presence in the human population of widespread immunity, which leads to a rapid limitation in the expression of target antigens. During epidemics, 15-25% of the human population suffers from adenoviral infections.
What  was the first reported baculovirus vector based vaccine for influenza? <BM25> While there is growing data on the potential use of baculovirus or pseudotyped baculovirus as a vaccine vector, efficacy data in mammalian animal models other than mice is lacking. There is also no data on the safety in humans, reducing enthusiasm for baculovirus as a vaccine vector for influenza at this time.

What animal adenoviruses have been shown to induce immunity comparable to rdA5-HA? <BM25> One drawback of an Ad5 vector is the potential for preexisting immunity, so alternative adenovirus serotypes have been explored as vectors, particularly non-human and uncommon human serotypes. Non-human adenovirus vectors include those from non-human primates , dogs, sheep, pigs, cows, birds and others . These vectors can infect a variety of cell types, but are generally attenuated in humans avoiding concerns of preexisting immunity. Swine, NHP and bovine adenoviruses expressing H5 HA antigens have been shown to induce immunity comparable to human rAd5-H5 vaccines . Recombinant, replication-defective adenoviruses from low-prevalence serotypes have also been shown to be efficacious. Low prevalence

What is an important feature of the replicon  system? <BM25> The structural proteins are provided in cell culture production systems. One important feature of the replicon systems is the self-replicating nature of the RNA. Despite the partial viral genome, the RNAs are self-replicating and can express transgenes at very high levels .
How did the VEE based replicon system incorporating HA from PR8perform? <BM25> a vaccine vector to deliver a CD8 + T cell epitope only. The well-characterized NP epitope was transgenically expressed in the SIN system and shown to be immunogenic in mice, priming a robust CD8 + T cell response and reducing influenza virus titer after challenge . More recently, a VEE replicon system expressing the HA protein of PR8 was shown to protect young adult and aged mice from lethal homologous challenge .

What are the appealing qualities of the NDV vector? <BM25> Newcastle disease virus is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus that causes disease in poultry. NDV has a number of appealing qualities as a vaccine vector. As an avian virus, there is little or no preexisting immunity to NDV in humans and NDV propagates to high titers in both chicken eggs and cell culture. As a paramyxovirus, there is no DNA phase in the virus lifecycle reducing concerns of integration events, and the levels of gene expression are driven by the proximity to the leader sequence at the 3' end of the viral genome. This gradient of gene expression enables attenuation

Cage 3 was vaccinated with vehicle . Cages 4 and 5 were vaccinated with MVA where cage 4 received a primary injection of vaccine at T = 0
What opportunity has the termination of smallpox vaccination provided? <BM25> Poxvirus vaccines have a long history and the notable hallmark of being responsible for eradication of smallpox. The termination of the smallpox virus vaccination program has resulted in a large population of poxvirus-naï ve individuals that provides the opportunity for the use of poxviruses as vectors without preexisting immunity concerns . Poxvirus-vectored vaccines were first proposed for use in 1982 with two reports of recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding and expressing functional thymidine kinase gene from herpes virus . Within a year, a vaccinia virus encoding the HA of an H2N2 virus was shown to express a functional HA protein and
What vaccinia vectors were created to address safety concerns? <BM25> Early work with intact vaccinia virus vectors raised safety concerns, as there was substantial reactogenicity that hindered recombinant vaccine development . Two vaccinia vectors were developed to address these safety concerns. The modified vaccinia virus Ankara strain was attenuated by passage 530 times in chick embryo fibroblasts cultures. The second, New York vaccinia virus was a plaque-purified clone of the Copenhagen vaccine strain rationally attenuated by deletion of 18 open reading frames .
How safe is MVA? <BM25> Adenoviruses have proven to be rather attractive systems for tissue targeted de!ivery of mamma!ian and microbia! genes in gene therapy and in vaccino!ogy, respectively. MVA holds promises as a safe and effective mucosa! vaccine de!ivery system. More genera!!y, suc!i non-rep!icative poxvira! vectors are promising mucosa! delivery systems.
What is the status of MVA influenza vaccine? <BM25> MVA as a leading viral-vectored candidate vaccine.

NYVAC is replication-restricted; however, it grows in chick embryo fibroblasts and Vero cells enabling vaccine-scale production. In non-permissive cells, critical late structural proteins are not produced stopping replication at the immature virion stage . NYVAC is very attenuated and considered safe for use in humans of all ages; however, it predominantly induces a CD4 + T cell response which is different compared to MVA . Both MVA and NYVAC provoke robust humoral responses, and can be delivered mucosally to induce mucosal antibody responses . There has been only limited exploration
What would limit the use of poxvirus vectored vaccines? <BM25> it has been observed that the ability of vaccinia to achieve Ab-mediated protection against smallpox is encouraging for the use of poxvirus vectored vaccines for Ab induction , caution is clearly required regarding their ability to induce responses to soluble secreted inserted Ags in Ag-naive animals. The situation in Agexperienced animals, in which the available Ag-specific B cell pool will be larger, is likely to be different: in this context, the Ag-specific B cell response to poxvirus vaccination may well constitute a considerably greater proportion of the total response. Viral vectors are better known for their ability to induce T
what is the advantage of the NYVAC as an influenza virus? <BM25> . Intriguingly, NYVAC may have an advantage for use as an influenza vaccine vector, because immunization with this vector induces weaker vaccine-specific immune responses compared to other poxvirus vaccines, a feature that may address the concerns surrounding preexisting immunity .

Why is a revision of current vaccines is needed? <BM25> To better control IBV in China, more detailed analysis of the biologic and antigenic characteristics of the predominant IBV isolates is warranted, and assessments of the effi cacy of current vaccines against these isolates are needed.
What is an example of an improved vaccine regime? <BM25> replication, immunity, and disease. There is also a need for revision of the current influenza virus vaccine strategies for at-risk populations, particularly those at either end of the age spectrum. An example of an improved vaccine regime might include the use of a vectored influenza virus vaccine that expresses the HA, NA and M and/or NP proteins for the two currently circulating influenza A subtypes and both influenza B strains so that vaccine take and vaccine antigen levels are not an issue in inducing protective immunity. Recombinant live-attenuated or replication-deficient influenza viruses may offer an advantage for this and other

What features can be created for creating vectored vaccines? <BM25> strains, subunit vaccines and viral vectored vaccines . Obviously, a successful RSV vaccine should induce protective immunity, but no immunopathology.
How can sustained immunity be generated? <BM25> sustained lung T RM cells and prolonged heterosubtype immunity 40 . Additional research into the mechanisms behind the longevity of lung T RM cells is needed to inform the design of efficacious cell-mediated vaccine strategies.
What is the advantage of vectored vaccines? <BM25> strains, subunit vaccines and viral vectored vaccines . Obviously, a successful RSV vaccine should induce protective immunity, but no immunopathology.
What  is the enhanced memory immune response linked to? <BM25> helps sustain a durable memory immune response, even augmenting the selection of higher affinity antibody secreting cells. The enhanced memory response is in part linked to the intrinsic augmentation of immunity induced by the vector. Thus, for weaker antigens typical of HA, vectored vaccines have the capacity to overcome real limitations in achieving robust and durable protection.
What cellular process is the Tat protein essential to? <BM25> The high mobility group protein, HMGA1 , was enriched in the nucleolus following Tat expression . HMGA1 interact with HIV-1 Integrase and is part of the HIV-1 pre-integration complex . Importantly, HMGA1 has been identified in a proteomic screen, as a cellular cofactor interacting with the HIV-1 59leader .
Where does the Tat protein move to in cells? <BM25> of CD4 cells through HIV-1 and the HIV-1 Tat protein is held to be responsible for an increased permeability of the BBB by influencing claudins . Possibly, disturbance of the BBB could be enhanced by an interaction of Nef and CLDN10.
What is a nucleolus? <BM25> nucleolus after HS .
Where are rRNA and ribosomes created? <BM25> lacking stress response transcription factors Yap1 and Skn7 indicate that the synthesis of new anti-oxidant proteins that are induced by oxidative stress might be required for protection of ribosomes. Consistently, blocking protein synthesis by pre-treatment with cycloheximide resulted in somehow stronger rRNA degradation .
How many proteins were shown to change the amount of Jurkat T-cell nucleolus significantly? <BM25> CASP10. The pro-apototic signaling molecule, Caspase 10 , was significantly depleted from the nucleolus of Jurkat-Tat cells . Importantly, Tat expression downregulates CASP10 expression and activity in Jurkat cells .
What cellular processes occur in the nucleolus? <BM25> The nucleolus is the site of additional RNA processing, including mRNA export and degradation, the maturation of uridine-rich small nuclear RNPs , which form the core of the spliceosome, biogenesis of t-RNA and microRNAs . The nucleolus is also involved in other cellular processes including cell cycle control, oncogenic processes, cellular stress responses and translation .
Which viruses target the nucleolus as part of their replication strategy? <BM25> Of importance, the nucleolus is also the target of viruses including HIV-1, hCMV, HSV and KSHV, as part of their replication strategy . Proteomics studies analysing the nucleoli of cells infected with Human respiratory syncytial virus , influenza A virus, avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus or adenovirus highlighted how viruses can distinctively disrupt the distribution of nucleolar proteins . Interestingly, both HIV-1 regulatory proteins Tat and Rev localise to the nucleoplasm and nucleolus. Both their sequences encompass a nucleolar localisation signal overlapping with their nuclear localisation signal , which governs their nucleolar localisation . Furthermore, Tat and Rev interact with
What nucleolar antigen is essential of localization of Tat and Rev proteins? <BM25> Contrary to the nuclear localization signals , nucleolar localization signals or sequences are not well characterized. Although several NoLSs have been described, no obvious consensus sequence has emerged. Nevertheless all NoLSs reported for nucleolus localizing virus proteins, such as HIV-1 Rev , HIV-1 Tat and human T-cell leukaemia virus type 1 Rex , and for cellular proteins such as the nucleolar protein p120 , Survivin-deltaEx3 and HSP70 are rich in basic residues. The capacity of numerous proteins to adopt nucleolar localization has been correlated with interaction of these proteins with B23. Owing to the ability of numerous nucleolar proteins to
What was studied in this report? <BM25> meat . Toxocara infections in goats have been poorly studied. We found only one seroprevalence report in goats. A 10.1% seroprevalence of anti-Toxocara antibodies was found in goats in Thessaly, Greece . Further studies about Toxocara infection in goats are needed.

What is the significance of this study? <BM25> Abbreviations: SNPs, single nucleotide polymorphisms. *P,0.05. no significance was observed on the clearance of HBV when the study was excluded .
How are Mammarenaviruses spread from rodents to humans? <BM25> Viral hemorrhagic fevers caused by mammarenaviruses represent a serious and increasing public health concern . Arenavirus-associated VHFs are zoonotic diseases, with humans acting as accidental hosts after contact with a viral reservoir, typically rodents . The old-world
What are the main groups for Mammarenaviruses? <BM25> in order to optimize preventative and control measures for mammarenaviruses.
What is the cause of Lassa fever? <BM25> Many pathogens have the ability to infect different species. Lassa fever virus is an important example; this virus infects a species of rodent in West Africa, and can cause a severe disease in people. Lassa fever virus is transmitted from rodent-to-rodent, rodent-to-human, human-to-human and perhaps human-to-rodent. So far, the relative importance of these routes has not been assessed.

What does ouabain inhibit? <BM25> of ouabain and lower concentrations of rocaglamide.
What method can significantly alleviate the emergence of drug-resistant variants in RNA viral infections? <BM25> Combination therapy can significantly alleviate the problem posed by the rapid emergence of drug-resistant variants commonly observed during monotherapy strategies to control RNA virus infections. Since ouabain and rocaglamide inhibited different steps of the LCMV life cycle, we examined whether their use in combination results in a synergistic anti-LCMV effect. For this experiment, we infected A549 cells with rLCMV/eGFP and treated them with ouabain and rocaglamide using different concentrations and combinations. At 48 h pi, we determined percent eGFP expression . Combination treatment with ouabain and rocaglamide resulted in synergistic anti-LCMV activity that was enhanced under conditions using higher concentrations
What factors did this study attribute to the efficient multiplication of mammarenaviruses? <BM25> IC 50 of 37.0 nM . We also tested the effect of compounds targeting ATP1A1 and PHB on multiplication of JUNV. Consistent with our results obtained with LCMV and LASV, ouabain, bufalin, and rocaglamide strongly suppressed JUNV multiplication . These findings indicate that ATP1A1 and PHB function as pro-viral factors of a range of mammarenaviruses.
How do the authors suggest that ATP1A1 and PHB contribute to the efficient multiplication of mammarenaviruses? <BM25> We identified ATP1A1 and PHB as novel host-cell proteins that contribute to efficient multiplication of mammarenaviruses. Our approach using a recombinant LCMV expressing NP with an affinity tag facilitated defining the NP interactome in the context of LCMV infection. Recently, using an NP-specific monoclonal antibody to precipitate NP and associated cellular protein partners in a mammarenavirus NP interactome, King et al. identified 348 host proteins that associated with LCMV NP . We found 99 common proteins between our filtered LCMV NP interactome of 171 proteins and the LCMV NP interactome documented by King et al. Differences in both experimental conditions
Which are the most abundant biological entities on Earth? <BM25> Abstract: The discovery of exoplanets within putative habitable zones revolutionized astrobiology in recent years. It stimulated interest in the question about the origin of life and its evolution. Here, we discuss what the roles of viruses might have been at the beginning of life and during evolution. Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on Earth. They are present everywhere, in our surrounding, the oceans, the soil and in every living being. Retroviruses contributed to about half of our genomic sequences and to the evolution of the mammalian placenta. Contemporary viruses reflect evolution ranging from the RNA world to the
What contributed to a large part of mammalian genomic sequence? <BM25> , the gp120 V1V5 region and the gp41 ectodomain were both required for resistance. Further mapping for one of these Envs demonstrated that the V1V2 domain contributed in large part to this phenotype, but the V3V5 domain in this context did not. Interestingly, some of the V1V2 domains in subject 185F contained changes in the predicted glycosylation pattern relative to the 0-month Env, while others had sequence changes that would not alter the original glycosylation pattern .
What were the earliest replicating entities that fulfill several criteria for life? <BM25> DNA-protein world. How far back can we trace their contribution? Earliest replicating and evolving entities are the ribozymes or viroids fulfilling several criteria of life. RNA can perform many aspects of life and influences our gene expression until today. The simplest structures with non-protein-coding information may represent models of life built on structural, not genetic information. Viruses today are obligatory parasites depending on host cells. Examples of how an independent lifestyle might have been lost include mitochondria, chloroplasts, Rickettsia and others, which used to be autonomous bacteria and became intracellular parasites or endosymbionts, thereby losing most of their genes. Even
What are some examples of autonomous bacteria that lost their independence and became intracellular  parasites or endosymbionts? <BM25> have given up their autonomous replication and became parasites -as has been described for some bacteria .
What entities with no genes satisfy the criteria for life? <BM25> aware, no one has yet set up an animal model of AIDS that would satisfy these criteria, and therefore model AIDS as a MAID. We cannot, therefore, rule out the possibility that AIDS is caused by some combination of agents, of which HIV is likely to be one.
Which group of RNA quasispecies satisfy criteria for life? <BM25> There are elements with zero genes that fulfill many criteria for early life: ribozymes, catalytic RNAs closely related to viroids. They were recovered in vitro from 10 15 molecules , 220 nucleotides in length, by 10 rounds of selection. Among the many RNA species present in this collection of quasispecies RNAs were catalytically active members, enzymatically active ribozymes. The sequence space for 220-mer RNAs is about 3 × 10 132 .
How are the ribozymes able to replicate <BM25> The selected ribozymes were able to replicate, cleave, join, and form peptide bonds. They can polymerize progeny chemically, allow for mutations to occur and can evolve. One molecule serves as catalyst, the other one as substrate. Replication of ribozymes was demonstrated in the test tube . Ribozymes can form peptide bonds between amino acids . Thus, small peptides were available by ribozyme activity. Consequently, an RNA modification has been proposed as peptide nucleic acid , with more stable peptide bonds instead of phosphodiester bonds . Replication of RNA molecules can be performed chemically from RNA without polymerase enzymes. In addition,
Does RNA replication need polymerase enzymes? <BM25> Restriction enzymes T7 RNA polymerase, RNasine, RQ DNase RNase free, MMLV-reverse transcriptase, Taq polymerase and pUC19 cloning vector were from Promega.
How can DNA arise chemically from RNA? <BM25> deoxyribozymes can form from ribonucleotides . Thus, DNA can arise from RNA chemically, without the key protein enzyme, the reverse transcriptase.
What do ribozymes consist of? <BM25> An entire living world is possible from non-coding RNA before evolution of the genetic code and protein enzymes. Ribozymes naturally consist of circular single-stranded RNAs . They lack the genetic triplet code and do not encode proteins. Instead, they exhibit structural information by hairpin-loops that form hydrogen bonds between incomplete double strands, and loops free to interact with other molecules. They represent a quasispecies in which many species of RNA may form, such as ribozymes, tRNA-like molecules, and other ncRNAs. RNAs within such a pool can bind amino acids. Ninety different amino acids have been identified on the Murchison meteorite
What do ribozymes lack? <BM25> Ribozymes are related to the protein-free viroids. Viroids are virus-like elements that belong to the virosphere, the world of viruses . Viroids lack protein coats and therefore were initially not designated as viruses but virus-like viroids when they were discovered in 1971 by Theodor Diener. He described viroids as "living fossils" .
What do ribozymes exhibit? <BM25> Due to the complexity and diversity of dominant mutations, even those of the RHO gene alone, there have been efforts to treat the condition by using molecules such as ribozymes, synthetic miRNAs, or siRNAs to target and degrade both mutant and wild-type mRNA; due to the degenerative effect this has on the retina, these therapeutic agents must be accompanied by delivery and expression of cDNA resistant to degradation because of silent mutations . Some other approaches that exhibit promise in the treatment of ADRP include AAV vector delivery of wild-type cDNA to slow retinal degeneration, and the gene transfer of

From what  language the disease gets its name? <BM25> Text: Chikungunya virus , a mosquito-borne pathogen listed by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases as a Category C Priority Pathogen that causes Chikungunya fever , has been spreading throughout Asia, Africa, and parts of Europe in recent times . CHIKV is an arthropod-borne virus and is transmitted to humans primarily by Aedes aegypti, the infamous yellow fever propagator . CHIKV infection is marked by severe joint pain, contorting its victims into unusual postures . The disease gets its name from the Kimakonde vernacular language of Tanzania and Mozambique, and the word chikungunya means ''that which contorts or bends

How is CHIKV maintained in Africa? <BM25> up'' and translates in Swahili to ''the illness of the bended walker'' . In Africa, CHIKV is maintained in a sylvatic cycle among forest-dwelling Aedes spp. mosquitoes, wild primates, squirrels, birds, and rodents . In Asia, the disease is vectored by Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus . Transmission in Asia occurs in an urban cycle whereby the mosquito spreads the disease from an infected human to an uninfected human, following an epidemiological pattern similar to dengue fever .
What is it vectored by <BM25> be expected to result in a reduction in the antigenicity of the vectored antigen.
How does the transmission in Asia occur? <BM25> Zika virus is an arthropod-borne flavivirus transmitted by mosquitoes. Transmission can also occur via the maternalfetal route, sexual intercourse , or direct exposure to blood . Outbreaks have occurred in Africa, Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, the Americas, and the Caribbean, most notably during the 2016 Olympic Games in Brazil .
What spurred  the discovery of the new vector Ae. albopictus? <BM25> The 2005-2006 epidemic of CHIKV in La Reunion islands in the Indian Ocean, spurred the discovery of a new vector species, Ae. albopictus . Wrecking over one-third of the island's population, this epidemic peaked its devastation between January and February 2006, when over 46,000 cases came into light every week, including 284 deaths . Ae. albopictus is common in urban areas of the United States and is already flourishing in 36 states, raising grave concerns to the immunologically naive populace of the United States .
In the epidemic  peak how many cases per week were there on the island? <BM25> median proportion of cases per week among deceased was 26% in the off-season and 29% in-season and during Christmas holidays. It ranged from 17% to a maximum of 38% in the 2014/15 influenza epidemic.

What are the recent activities of CHIKV? <BM25> CHIKV has been isolated into three genotypes based on phylogenetic studies. These genotypes, based on the gene sequences of an Envelope protein , are Asian, East/Central/ South African, and West African . Using phylogenetic models, Cherian et al. estimate that the Asian genotype of CHIKV emerged between 50 and 310 y ago, and the West and East African genotypes diverged between 100 and 840 y ago . Since then, CHIKV has come a long way, with several mutations incorporated, and has continued to wreak epidemics in several regions. Recent activities of CHIKV include the Indian epidemic in 2005-2006, which was
How was the Italian isolation found to have evolved from? <BM25> In the Italian multicenter study conducted in 1993±1994 in 99 ICUs , 52 % of 1101 patients had SIRS on admission; at any time during the study, SIRS only was recorded in 58 % of patients, sepsis in another 16 %, severe sepsis in 5.5 %, and septic shock in 6 %. Overall, 85 % of patients had one of the septic syndromes, of which more than two-thirds were non-microbiologically documented SIRS. Similarly to the study from Iowa the investigators noted that a substantial proportion of patients evolved from an earlier stage on admission to a more severe one: 15

All of the CHIKV strains isolated from Mayotte carried the E1-A226V mutation, and the mutation was also found in Madagascar in 2007 . The E1-A226V mutation was not present at the beginning of the Indian Ocean Islands outbreak . However, more than 90% of later viral strains found there had incorporated the mutation , indicating a genotype switch during the winter season .
What percentage of population was affected? <BM25> Differences were found in the affected age groups among the Roma/Sinti and the rest of population. As expected in a susceptible population, the most affected age group in the Roma/Sinti population was the 1-4 year-old age group. Conversely, in the Italian ethnic population, which had a higher percentage of vaccinated subjects with respect to the Roma/Sinti population, especially among young children, most cases occurred in the 15-19 year-old age-group.

Despite inadequate personal protections, healthcare workers in Africa continued to provide care to infected persons, and the epidemic resulted in the deaths of hundreds of healthcare workers .
What does the study suggest would make healthcare workers more willing to care for patients during an Ebola virus outbreak? <BM25> plagues, but ongoing, as seen with the recent Ebola outbreak. Despite inadequate personal protections, healthcare workers in Africa continued to provide care to infected persons, and the epidemic resulted in the deaths of hundreds of healthcare workers .
What causes avian infectious bronchitis? <BM25> bovine coronaviruses this polypeptide bears O-glycosidically linked oligosaccharides, and in the case of avian infectious bronchitis virus it bears Nglycosidically linked oligosaccharides.
What differentiated the two chicken lines used in this  study? <BM25> In the literature it has been described that human blood cell lines were susceptible for infection with poliovirus , and that study demonstrated that well-differentiated human blood cell lines are more susceptible to cytopathic effects of poliovirus than the less-differentiated blood cell lines. From the selection of cell lines we used in this study, K562 cells were the least differentiated, but with respect to viral replication we did not observe a difference between K562 cells and the more differentiated cell lines.

Why  have bats received attention in recent years? <BM25> be effective in suppressing the epidemic and have been paid much more attention in recent years.
What difference bats demonstrate compared to most non-Chiropteran mammals? <BM25> The roles played by bats in the maintenance and transmission of viruses requires consideration of the unique characteristics that distinguish bats from all other mammals.
What suite of species-specific mechanisms do bats have to limit viral load? <BM25> Recent research advances are beginning to shed light on the molecular mechanisms by which bats avoid pathology from these otherwise virulent pathogens . Bats leverage a suite of species-specific mechanisms to limit viral load, which include host receptor sequence incompatibilities for some bat-virus combinations and constitutive expression of the antiviral cytokine, IFN-a, for others . Typically, the presence of viral RNA or DNA in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells will induce secretion of type I interferon proteins , which promote expression and translation of interferon-stimulated genes in neighboring cells and render them effectively antiviral . In some bat cells, the
How are mammalian cells typically rendered antiviral? <BM25> we became interested in finding out if members of group II nucleopolyhedroviruses can induce antiviral activity in mammalian cells similar to that of AcMNPV.
In non-flying mammals <BM25> birds and mammals .
What do the bats do instead? <BM25> When a probability P is difficult or impossible to estimate, it is sometimes easier to estimate its inverse probability , the probability that it does not happen. It would be tedious to quantitatively estimate probabilities in the case of ebolavirus maintenance given the current lack of information, but trying to define the components of this probability could help. Hence, instead of proving that bats are the maintenance host for EBOV, what if we consider that "bats are not the maintenance host for EBOV"?
Why may the bats have this unique adaptation? <BM25> from those unique to bats.
Why  was the field of virus dynamics developed? <BM25> mathematical models. Perhaps the earliest and simplest classical virus dynamics model was developed by Kermack et al. in and Anderson et al. in as follows
How are bats connected to fatal viral diseases? <BM25> severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome .
What is  an example of anti-viral defense in bats? <BM25> bats appear to share the immune cell and gene repertoire with other mammals, it has been repeatedly hypothesized that the long-term co-existence of bats and viruses must have imposed strong selective pressures on the bat genome and that those genes related to the first line of antiviral defense within the innate immune system, e.g., TLRs, may reflect this co-evolution .
What would be caused by  this hyper-vigilance in most other mammals? <BM25> Plasmodium parasites and host biodiversity. Malaria is caused by protozoan parasites that belong mainly to the genus Plasmodium. More than 200 Plasmodium species have been identified that can infect mammals , birds, or reptiles. Among mammals, primates are by far the most common intermediate host for Plasmodium parasites.
How are bats different? <BM25> bats and their pathogens .
What bat species cells were compared? <BM25> Available TLR8 sequences of other bat species were included in our analyses and compared to the equine and human orthologous.
What was the conclusion of the study ? <BM25> The study statistician is blinded to the treatment allocation, and study investigators will remain blinded to the results until the conclusion of the study.
What would be the benefit of learning more about bat's defenses and how they  drive virus evolution? <BM25> countered by the virus spreading more quickly from cell to cell. This suggests that bat immune defenses may drive the evolution of faster transmitting viruses, and while bats are well protected from the harmful effects of their own prolific viruses, other creatures like humans are not.
Which cells are IFN-defective and therefore limited in  antiviral capacity? <BM25> control. This result therefore confirms and validates the antiviral capacity of RC against the viral entry stage of HCV.
What cells demonstrate idiosyncratic interferon response? <BM25> of exposure to influenza virus , T-cells that lacked the ability to respond to type I interferon did not increase IFITM3 expression in response to virus . Collectively these data demonstrate that distinct signalling pathways drive IFITM3 expression in T cells following TCR engagement or exposure to influenza virus.
Which cells express constitutive IFN-a? <BM25> To explore the role of IRF1 in local immunity, we first demonstrated that BEAS-2B bronchial epithelial cells constitutively express IRF1, and that IFNβ enhances and induces translocation of IRF1 to the nucleus . We then used CRISPR-Cas9 technology to create IRF1 deficient BEAS2B cell lines, and confirmed IRF1 deficiency, both constitutive and 3h post-stimulation with IFNβ, by western blot .
How were  the spread of GFP-expressing virus-infected cells across tissue monolayers tracked via inverted fluorescence microscopy? <BM25> Because plaque assays restrict viral transmission neighbor-to-neighbor in two-dimensional cellular space , we were able to track the spread of GFP-expressing virus-infected cells across tissue monolayers via inverted fluorescence microscopy. For each infection trial, we monitored and re-imaged plates for up to 200 hr of observations or until total monolayer destruction, processed resulting images, and generated a time series of the proportion of infectious-cell occupied plate space across the duration of each trial . We used generalized additive models to infer the time course of all cell culture replicates and construct the multi-trial dataset to which we eventually fit our
How were  the spread of GFP-expressing virus-infected cells tracked? <BM25> example, the original seeds of SARS can be successfully tracked by a small fraction of epidemic data . In this sense, we will take here a typical complex network as the infrastructure for an epidemic to spread.
How was the modeling carried out? <BM25> flexible-backbone protein-protein docking can now be carried out routinely as long as experimental structures or high-quality homology models exist . Additionally, molecular modeling in conjunction with XL-MS has allowed us to provide detailed structures of bacteria-human HP-PPCs .
What was the finding in this study? <BM25> during the study from hospitalized children were also negative when assayed for these properties , a finding which reflects that of two other investigations .
What supports the results? <BM25> 96% of the results from the field were confirmed at the Robert Koch-Institute in Germany, which supports the efficacy of a field laboratory.
What was additionally demonstrated? <BM25> number of multiply infected red cells . Additionally, the effective cryopreservation of the MCB was demonstrated by the fact that parasite viability was over 50% after 3 months.
What do  the studies suggest? <BM25> Other studies suggest that nitric-oxide treatment can ameliorate hypoxemia caused by ischemia-reperfusion injury, but does not prevent injury .
What was the methodology for this study? <BM25> part of these studies for a detailed description of the study methodology).
What was demonstrated in deriving the equation for R 0? <BM25> Much of the subsequent analysis will concern itself with deriving an equation equivalent to for the household reproduction number R * .
What is a conclusion of the modeling? <BM25> In conclusion, we find several factors not often accounted for that may improve the accuracy of modeling EVD.
What is a conclusion of the study? <BM25> The study statistician is blinded to the treatment allocation, and study investigators will remain blinded to the results until the conclusion of the study.
What do  fits to rVSV-MARV infections on PaKiT01 cells suggest? <BM25> two Langmuir isotherms with affinities constrained to those of CNGA1 homomers and CNGA1 + CNGB1 heteromers. Instead, fits to the sum of two Langmuir isotherms revealed a small high affinity component similar to that of CNGA1 + CNGB1 channels , and a larger component with an affinity intermediate between that of CNGA1 homomers and CNGA1 + CNGB1 heteromers . These results suggest that the heteromers formed from CNGA1-∆CLZ and CNGB1-∆N are not a mixture of CNGA1 homomers and normal CNGA1 + CNGB1 heteromers, but, instead, a mixture of normal 3:1 CNGA1 + CNGB1 heteromers and novel CNGA1 + CNGB1 heteromers.
What do the findings indicate? <BM25> in the TLR9 −/− BMDMs ). These findings indicate that the immunosuppressive effects of CpG-c41 on TLR3 and TLR7 do not require interaction with TLR9.
What is a conclusion of  this study? <BM25> The study statistician is blinded to the treatment allocation, and study investigators will remain blinded to the results until the conclusion of the study.
What age group has the highest rate of severe outcomes? <BM25> cases in the United States by age group found that 80% of deaths were among adults 65 years and older with the highest percentage of severe outcomes occurring in people 85 years and older.

What type of virus is SARS-CoV-2? <BM25> type virus infection.
What viruses are similar to the COVID-19 coronavirus? <BM25> not cross-react with other coronavirus and also human clinical samples that contained respiratory viruses .
What are the phases of a pandemic? <BM25> by a deceleration phase, during which there is a decrease in illnesses. Different countries can be in different phases of the pandemic at any point in time and different parts of the same country can also be in different phases of a pandemic.
At which phase does the peak of the pandemic occur? <BM25> This current study was carried out in three phases during the pandemic peak season of A/H1N1. The first phase was from 30 November 2009 to 27 December 2009, the second from 4 January 2010 to 24 January 2010, and the third from 24 February to 25 March in 2010.
People with which medical conditions have a higher rate of severe illness? <BM25> Older people and people with severe chronic conditions should take special precautions because they are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness.
What kind of test can diagnose COVID-19? <BM25> CDC developed an rRT-PCR test to diagnose COVID-19.
In what species did the COVID-19 virus likely originate? <BM25> Our data indicate that at least some SJIA urine peptide biomarkers likely originate in circulation and are filtered into the urine.
What risk factors should be considered in addition to clinical symptoms? <BM25> Multiple logistic regression was applied to investigate risk factors associated with the onset of symptoms after discharge from the ED. P-values of 0AE05 or less were considered statistically significant.
What is the acronym SARS-CoV-2? <BM25> differ for ambiguous typical and unambiguous acronyms by definition pronounced in a typical acronym manner.
When was SARS-CoV-2 first identified? <BM25> pathogen . The first identified M. bovis-associated pulmonary disease in 26.1%
Where was SARS-CoV-2 first identified? <BM25> pathogen . The first identified M. bovis-associated pulmonary disease in 26.1%
What factor positively correlates with imported-and-reported cases counts of SARS-CoV-2 infection? <BM25> We found that daily air travel volume positively correlates with imported-and-reported case counts of SARS-CoV-2 infection among high surveillance locations . We noted that increasing flight volume by 31 passengers/day is associated with 1 additional expected imported-and-reported case. In addition, Singapore and India lie above the 95% PI in our model; Singapore had 12 more imported-and-reported cases than expected and India had 3 more than expected. Thailand has a relatively high air travel volume compared with other locations, but it lies below the 95% PI, reporting 16 fewer imported-and-reported cases than expected under the model. Indonesia lies below the PI

Where did the first known cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) occur? <BM25> of SARS-CoV-2 was higher than the Middle East respiratory syndrome in the Middle East countries, similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome, but lower than MERS in the Republic of Korea.
Where was the the case first to be publicly reported was from ? <BM25> to new infection from the symptomatic class , the isolated class , and the dead class , respectively. When vaccine is included, i.e., ξ > 0, η > 0, the reproduction number can be calculated as R 0V = ηR 0 , where R 0 is given by . Data fitting and parameter estimation. We obtained data of the total cumulative cases and deaths for Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia from the World Health Organization 1 . We used t 0 as the starting date for each country when the first infectious case was reported 20 . We compiled publicly available
In what animals MERS-CoV sequences have been found ? <BM25> and were 97.9-98.2% identical to, the FeLV-A/61E strain , while the sequence obtained from the lynx found to be proviruspositive in 2004 was only 94.8-95% identical to the other sequences and was more related to FeLV-A/Rickard . The predicted amino acid sequences of the SU glycoprotein from animals infected in 2007 presented an identity/similarity of 97.3-97.6%/98.6-98.9% to FeLV-A/61E and of 95.9-96.2%/97.6-97.8% to FeLV-A/Rickard, respectively, while the identity/similarity of the sequence from the animal infected in 2004 was 97.3%/98.6% to FeLV-A/61E, 96.2%/97.8% to FeLV-A/Rickard, and 96.7-97.0%/98.9-99.2% to the 2007 sequences, respectively.

What does MERS-COV cause? <BM25> cause.
Precisely how does the virus transmit to humans? <BM25> Avian influenza started in waterfowls, which asymptomatically carry the virus, and transmit the virus to poultry, which in turn may transmit it to humans. However, the virus is unable to maintain sustainability once infecting humans .
What appears to be a requirement for transmission? <BM25> 2. In Fig. 2 , the position of Lys48 should be indicated. 1) The authors seem to explain the lack of activity against di-ubiquitin chains as resulting from a requirement for longer chains binding into the S2 site. If this is true, then why is OtDUB also more active against longer K48-linked chains, when based on the structure the S1-S2 connectivity appears to be K63-specific?
What is a focal point of MERS? <BM25> but close and lengthy exposure appears to be a requirement. The KSA is the focal point of MERS, with the majority of human cases. In humans, MERS is mostly known as a lower respiratory tract disease involving fever, cough, breathing difficulties and pneumonia that may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiorgan failure and death in 20 % to 40 % of those infected. However, MERS-CoV has also been detected in mild and influenza-like illnesses and in those with no signs or symptoms. Older males most obviously suffer severe disease and MERS patients often have comorbidities. Compared to severe acute

In humans, MERS is mostly known as a lower respiratory tract disease involving fever, cough, breathing difficulties and pneumonia that may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiorgan failure and death in 20 % to 40 % of those infected. However, MERS-CoV has also been detected in mild and influenza-like illnesses and in those with no signs or symptoms. Older males most obviously suffer severe disease and MERS patients often have comorbidities. Compared to severe acute
What does the MERS LRT disease involve? <BM25> The first known MERS human-to-human transmission event was one characterized by acute LRT disease in a healthcare setting in Jordan. In stark contrast, a sero-survey of HCW who were sometimes in close and prolonged contact with the first, fatal MERS-CoV case in 2012 , found none of the HCW had seroconverted four months later, despite an absence of eye protection and variable compliance with required PPE standards .
Where else MERS-COV has also been detected? <BM25> Or else what they are doing should not be assimilated to constructivist thought at all.

Among whom 20% of the virus detection are reported? <BM25> Among the animal viruses, a one-step, RT-LAMP assay was reported for detection of Foot and Mouth Disease virus in less than 1 h in a single tube without thermal cycling . A fragment of the 3D RNA polymerase gene of the virus is amplified at 65 C in the presence of a
What have sero-surveys of MERS virus found? <BM25> Suspected cases of SARS coronavirus and MERS coronavirus require immediate notification to the laboratory. Guidance for testing can be found at www.cdc.gov/sars/index.html and www. cdc.gov/coronavirus/MERS/index.html.
How was the first culture of the new Coronavirus announced? <BM25> Text: An email from Dr Ali Mohamed Zaki, an Egyptian virologist working at the Dr Soliman Fakeeh Hospital in Jeddah in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia announced the first culture of a new coronavirus to the world. The email was published on the website of the professional emerging diseases network on 20 th September 2012 and described the first reported case, a 60 year old man from Bisha in the KSA. This information led to the rapid discovery of a second case of the virus, this time in an ill patient in the United Kingdom, who had been transferred from

Whose was the first reported case? <BM25> Here we describe the epidemiology of the first cases of COVID-19 in this region, excluding cases reported in the United Kingdom , as at 21 February 2020. The study includes a comparison between cases detected among travellers from China and cases whose infection was acquired due to subsequent local transmission.
How many  viral RNA or virus-specific antibodies been detected? <BM25> antibodies for 1 h and then infected with FMDV. The viral yields were measured by TCID 50 assay at 12 hpi. PK-15 cells were transfected with vector plasmids or Myc-EGR1 plasmids for 24 h. The transfected cells were infected with SVV for 12 h. The viral RNA, ISG15 and ISG54 expression levels were detected by qPCR. * P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant and * * P < 0.01 was considered as highly significant.
What is the death rate from MERS-COV? <BM25> positive death rate, so trees are not ultrametric.
What did the discovery process over two to three years reveal? <BM25> Since that first report, a slow discovery process over the following two to three years revealed a virus that had infected over 90 % of adult dromedary camels in the KSA , also DCs across the Arabian Peninsula and parts of Africa that are a source of DC imports for the KSA . To date, MERS-CoV has not been detected in DCs tested in zoos or herds from other parts of the world . Occasionally, virus is transmitted from infected DCs to exposed humans. Subsequent transmission to other humans requires relatively close and prolonged exposure .
What does subsequent transmission of MERS-CoV to other humans require? <BM25> and transmission to humans cannot be excluded.
What would restrict access to both the virus and to viral diagnostics ? <BM25> The first viral isolate was patented and concerns were raised that this would restrict access to both the virus and to viral diagnostics . However, sensitive, validated reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction -based diagnostics were quickly described and virus was made freely available subject to routine biosafety considerations . Subsequent epidemiology and research has identified the cell receptor as exopeptidase dipeptidyl peptidase 4 ; that MERS-CoV has a broad tropism, replicating better in some cells lines and eliciting a more proinflammatory response than SARS-CoV; is widespread in DCs; has the potential to infect other animals and that MERS kills
How was the virus then made freely available? <BM25> cell-line virus combination. All fitting and model comparison scripts are freely available for download at the following FigShare repository: DOI: 10.6084/m9.figshare.8312807.
What has epidemiology and research identified the MERS-CoV's cell receptor is? <BM25> The identification of SP-D receptors is important for understanding its immune-regulatory and homeostatic functions in different cell types. A series of SP-D receptors, or receptor candidates, have been identified; however, the cellular effects of SP-D via some of these receptors have yet to be determined mechanistically and validated by independent research.
How does MERS-CoV compare with SARS-CoV? <BM25> are used to compare SAR ADCs.

What is the spread of MERS-CoV among humans <BM25> when a virus such as H5N1 might acquire the properties needed to spread easily and sustainably among humans.
What do the DCs suffer with MERS-CoV infection? <BM25> Although DCs appear to suffer the equivalent of a 'common cold' from MERS-CoV infection, in humans, the virus can be a more serious and opportunistic pathogen associated with the death of up to 40 % of reported cases. It has yet to be established whether infections thought to have been acquired from an animal source produce a more severe outcome than those spread between humans . Studies have established that the mean incubation period for MERS is five to six days, ranging from two to 16 days, with 13 to 14 days between when illness begins in one person and
What happens to humans infected by MERS-CoV virus? <BM25> these properties only depend on what happens in the intervals after the interval of infection. We can compute these properties for the herd infected at t = 0.
What is the incubation period of MERS? <BM25> involving 82 patients in South Korea, and the median incubation period was estimated to be 7 days with a range of 2 to 17 days . At the end of 2015, there were 1621 confirmed MERS with a 36% mortality rate .
What is the duration between when illness begins in one person and subsequently spreads to another? <BM25> subsequently spreads to another . Among those with progressive illness, the median time to death is 11 to 13 days, ranging from five to 27 days . Fever and gastrointestinal symptoms may form a prodrome, after which symptoms decline, only to be followed by a more severe systemic and respiratory syndrome .
What is the median time to death in case of progressive illness? <BM25> subsequently spreads to another . Among those with progressive illness, the median time to death is 11 to 13 days, ranging from five to 27 days . Fever and gastrointestinal symptoms may form a prodrome, after which symptoms decline, only to be followed by a more severe systemic and respiratory syndrome .
What is the progression  of symptoms to disease? <BM25> 1. A failed initial therapy is defined as either of the following situations in a patient: the symptoms are not improved after initial therapy, and requiring alternative antibiotics; exacerbation and disease progression after initial improvement during initial therapy .
What did the later WHO definition of MERS clearly state? <BM25> which clearly depends only on time t and not state X. The total incidence at time t is defined by the integral
What percentage of cases KSA has been a source of? <BM25> network as the new source. According to this way, we will stop until the percentage g of immunized nodes is reached.
What is severe MARS noted for? <BM25> press/nyhetsarkiv/2020/mars/flera-tecken-pa-samhallsspridning-av-covid-19-i-sverige/ .
What symptoms appear among the  confirmed cases of MERS? <BM25> the mild MERS and SARS cases , and likely among the 2019-nCoV cases.
What do patients often present to a hospital with <BM25> Education on these changes is conducted, and the plan exercised again. Too often hospital disaster exercises stop with the patients being processed through the ED/A&E and do not require inpatient decision-making.
What can  MERS disease progress to? <BM25> or worse, and secondary bacterial infections have been reported . Disease can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan system failure . MERS has reportedly killed approximately 35 % of all reported cases, 42 % of cases in the KSA, yet only 19 % of cases in South Korea, where mortality ranged from 7 % among younger age groups to 40 % among those aged 60 years and above ; all may be inflated values with asymptomatic or mild infections sometimes not sought or not reported . General supportive care is key to managing severe cases . Children under

General supportive care is key to managing severe cases . Children under
What was mortality in  South Korea from MERS disease? <BM25> involving 82 patients in South Korea, and the median incubation period was estimated to be 7 days with a range of 2 to 17 days . At the end of 2015, there were 1621 confirmed MERS with a 36% mortality rate .
Which are the preferred method for MERS-CoV detection? <BM25> described, cell culture is a slow, specialised and insensitive method while PCR-based techniques are the preferred method for MERS-CoV detection.
What  have become a key diagnostic and taxonomic target for CoV species identification? <BM25> The first open reading frames have become a key diagnostic and taxonomic target for CoV species identification. With less than 80 % identity between the amino acid sequence of MERS ORF 1ab and betacoronavirus relatives, Tylonycteris bat HKU4 and Pipistrellus bat HKU5, it can be concluded that it is a novel and distinct virus. MERS-CoV is predicted to encode ten open reading frames with 5' and 3' untranslated regions . The structural proteins include the spike , envelope , membrane and nucleocapsid . The products of ORF1a and ORF1b are predicted to encode nonstructural proteins.

The products of ORF1a and ORF1b are predicted to encode nonstructural proteins.
What  indicates the likely presence of infectious virus? <BM25> A comparison of the two curves indicates that the presence of HEPES resulted in a faster rate of virus production during the first 12 hours after inoculation, giving a 10 fold increase in the peak titre. This was followed by a less marked decrease in the amount of infectious virus, suggesting that the virus infectivity was more stable in the presence of HEPES.
What is the sensitivity with which immunochromatographic tool could detect recombinant MERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein? <BM25> The detection of MERS-CoV antigen has not been common to date but the combination of short turnaround time from test to result, high throughput and identification of viral proteins makes this an attractive option. Detection of viral proteins rather than viral RNA indicates the likely presence of infectious virus. The first rapid immunochromatographic tool described could detect recombinant MERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein from DC nasal swabs with 94 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity compared to RT-rtPCR . A different approach used a monoclonal antibody-based capture ELISA targeting the MERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein with a sensitivity of 10 3 TCID 50 and

A different approach used a monoclonal antibody-based capture ELISA targeting the MERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein with a sensitivity of 10 3 TCID 50 and
What is a different approach for the detection? <BM25> In sum, these studies highlight the strength of comparative approach in detection of RNA structures in the CDS. Different comparative methods used by these studies can be compared and combined to achieve better results. However, these powerful comparative approaches are underutilized by virologists.
What is usual in serology testing? <BM25> Demonstration of a seroconversion to a MERS-CoV infection meets the current WHO definition of a case so optimized and thoroughly validated sero-assays employed alongside good clinical histories are useful to both identify prior MERS-CoV infection and help support transmission studies. Because serology testing is, by its nature, retrospective, it is usual to detect a viral footprint, in the form of antibodies, in the absence of any signs or symptoms of disease and often in the absence of any viral RNA .
How have some sero-assays bypassed the risks of working with infectious virus? <BM25> Some sero-assays have bypassed the risks of working with infectious virus by creating transfected cells expressing recombinant portions of the MERS-CoV nucleocapsid and spike proteins , or using a recombinant lentivirus expressing MERS-CoV spike protein and luciferase . A pseudo particle neutralization assay has seen widespread used in animal studies and was at least as sensitive as the traditional microneutralization test. ] Studies using small sample numbers and ppNT found no evidence of MERS-CoV neutralizing antibody in sera from 158 children with LRT infections between May 2010 and May 2011, 110 sera from 19 to 52 year old male blood
What is the  detection of MERS-CoV infection using ELISA or S1 subunit protein microarray [84] is usually followed by? <BM25> specific than the recombinant IFA discussed above. It was still considered an applicable tool for screening large sample numbers . A protein microarray expressing the S1 protein subunit has also been validated and widely used for DC testing . Detection of MERS-CoV infection using ELISA or S1 subunit protein microarray is usually followed by confirmatory IFA and/ or a plaque-reduction neutralization or MNT test. This confirmatory process aims toensure the antibodies detected are able to specifically neutralize the intended virus and are not more broadly reactive to other coronaviruses found in DCs or humans . In the largest study of
What does the confirmatory process aim to  ensure? <BM25> The researchers discussed potential problems throughout the research process to ensure the integrity of the data.
When does  generally MERS infection does not trigger a detectable immune response? <BM25> MERS-CoV does not appear to be easily transmitted from DCs to humans, or perhaps it is , but generally does not trigger a detectable immune response if only mild disease or asymptomatic infection results. Serology assays are in need of further validation in this area so care is required when moving newly developed diagnostic serology algorithms from a research setting to one that informs public health decisions. This was reinforced when a false positive US case, purported to have been infected after a handshake and two face-to-face meetings, did not withstand further confirmatory analysis using a more specific, NT assay

What do the recommended samples include? <BM25> recommended by the government; the advice may include maintaining a recommended physical
What are recommended when URT sampling is to  be conducted? <BM25> The URT is a less invasive and more convenient sampling site however, and an oropharyngeal and throat swab or a nasopharyngeal aspirate/wash are recommended when URT sampling is to be conducted . Paired sera, collected two to three weeks apart are preferable for serological testing while a single sample is suggested to be sufficient if collected two weeks after onset of disease or a single serum collected during the first 10-12 days if conducting RT-rtPCR . Human urine and stool have been found to contain MERS-CoV RNA 12 to 26 days after symptom onset and are listed as samples that
What paired sera are preferable? <BM25> the value of paired sera can be limited by the fact that seroconversion usually precedes the abortion.
When is a single sample  suggested to be sufficient? <BM25> The URT is a less invasive and more convenient sampling site however, and an oropharyngeal and throat swab or a nasopharyngeal aspirate/wash are recommended when URT sampling is to be conducted . Paired sera, collected two to three weeks apart are preferable for serological testing while a single sample is suggested to be sufficient if collected two weeks after onset of disease or a single serum collected during the first 10-12 days if conducting RT-rtPCR . Human urine and stool have been found to contain MERS-CoV RNA 12 to 26 days after symptom onset and are listed as samples that
How long human urine and stool have been found to contain MERS-CoV RNA? <BM25> The URT is a less invasive and more convenient sampling site however, and an oropharyngeal and throat swab or a nasopharyngeal aspirate/wash are recommended when URT sampling is to be conducted . Paired sera, collected two to three weeks apart are preferable for serological testing while a single sample is suggested to be sufficient if collected two weeks after onset of disease or a single serum collected during the first 10-12 days if conducting RT-rtPCR . Human urine and stool have been found to contain MERS-CoV RNA 12 to 26 days after symptom onset and are listed as samples that
What do individual studies report on viral  shedding? <BM25> Individual human case studies report long periods of viral shedding, sometimes intermittently and not necessarily linked to the presence of disease symptoms. In one instance, a HCW shed viral RNA for 42 days in the absence of disease . It is an area of high priority to better understand whether such cases are able to infect others. Over three quarters of MERS cases shed viral RNA in their LRT specimens for at least 30 days, while only 30 % of contacts were still shedding RNA in their URT specimens .
What fraction of MERS cases shed viral RNA in their LRT specimens (tracheal aspirates and sputum) ? <BM25> Individual human case studies report long periods of viral shedding, sometimes intermittently and not necessarily linked to the presence of disease symptoms. In one instance, a HCW shed viral RNA for 42 days in the absence of disease . It is an area of high priority to better understand whether such cases are able to infect others. Over three quarters of MERS cases shed viral RNA in their LRT specimens for at least 30 days, while only 30 % of contacts were still shedding RNA in their URT specimens .

Over three quarters of MERS cases shed viral RNA in their LRT specimens for at least 30 days, while only 30 % of contacts were still shedding RNA in their URT specimens .
What  samples  returned the highest MERS viral load values? <BM25> In the only study to examine the effect of sample type on molecular analysis, 64 nasopharyngeal aspirates , 30 tracheal aspirates, 13 sputa and three BAL were examined. The tracheal aspirates and BAL returned the highest viral load values followed by NPA and sputum. Unsurprisingly, higher viral loads generally paralleled whole genome sequencing and culture success and, in NPA testing, were significantly correlated with severe disease and death . This study demonstrated the importance of LRT sampling for whole genome sequencing.
What is NPA? <BM25> Of the 397 sequenced NPA samples, HRV-A was detected in 204 , HRV-B in 39 and HRV-C in 154 . The annual distribution of HRV-B was as SO6507_08 99 0·02

What is BAL? <BM25> in BAL fluid .
What is the the proportion of deaths among those infected with MERS-CoV? <BM25> Adolescents and youth, 10 to 24 years of age, represent a growing proportion of people living with HIV around the world and have worse outcomes than all other age groups . In recent years, AIDS-related deaths among adolescents and youth increased by 50% while they have decreased among all other age groups . In 2018, 510,000 young people between the ages of 10 to 24 years were newly-infected with HIV, 40% of whom were between 10 and 19 years of age . In addition to heterosexual transmission, a generation of children infected with HIV perinatally are now aging into adolescence,
What   has prevented worldwide spread of MERS-COV? <BM25> The 2-3 % prevalence of active MERS-CoV infections is not dissimilar to the hospital-based prevalence of other human CoVs. However, the proportion of deaths among those infected with MERS-CoV is much higher than that known for the HCoVs NL63, HKU1, 229E or OC43 in other countries, and even above that for SARS-CoV; it is not a virus that could reasonably be described as a "storm in a teacup". It is the low transmission rate that has prevented worldwide spread, despite many "opportunities".
What must be reported to the world organization for animal health as an emerging disease ? <BM25> Very early in the MERS outbreak, some animals were highly regarded as either the reservoir or intermediate host of MERS-CoV with three of the first five cases having contact with DCs . Today, animal MERS-CoV infections must be reported to the world organization for animal health as an emerging disease . A summary of the first MERS cases reported by the WHO defined animal contact with humans as being direct and within 10 days prior to symptom onset . This definition made no specific allowance for acquisition from DCs through a droplet-based route, which is very likely route for acquisition
What are juvenile DCs more often positive for? <BM25> Screening studies have shown that juvenile DCs are more often positive for virus or viral RNA while older DCs are more likely to be seropositive and RNA or virus negative . In adult DCs, MERS-CoV RNA has been detected among animals with pre-existing antibody, suggesting re-infection is possible . Viral loads among positive DCs can be very high and DCs have been found positive both when ill with URT respiratory signs or when apparently healthy . These findings indicate DCs host natural MERS-CoV infections. Furthermore, stored DC sera have revealed signs of MERS-CoV in DCs which date back over three
What are older DCs are more likely to be positive for? <BM25> Screening studies have shown that juvenile DCs are more often positive for virus or viral RNA while older DCs are more likely to be seropositive and RNA or virus negative . In adult DCs, MERS-CoV RNA has been detected among animals with pre-existing antibody, suggesting re-infection is possible .

When does the camel calving season? <BM25> Camel calving season occurs in the winter months and this may be a time when there is increased risk to humans of spill-over due to new infections among naïve DC populations . What role maternal camel antibody might play in delaying infection of calves remains unknown . Juvenile DCs appear to host active infection more often than adult DCs and thus the sacrificial slaughter of DCs, which must be five years of age or older , may not be accompanied by significant risk of exposure to infection. In contrast to earlier results, slaughterhouse workers who kill both younger and older
Why is there an increased risk to humans of spill-over during calving season? <BM25> Camel calving season occurs in the winter months and this may be a time when there is increased risk to humans of spill-over due to new infections among naïve DC populations . What role maternal camel antibody might play in delaying infection of calves remains unknown . Juvenile DCs appear to host active infection more often than adult DCs and thus the sacrificial slaughter of DCs, which must be five years of age or older , may not be accompanied by significant risk of exposure to infection. In contrast to earlier results, slaughterhouse workers who kill both younger and older
Which may be an occupational group with significantly higher incidence of seropositivity to MERS-CoV ? <BM25> DCs, may be an occupational group with significantly higher incidence of seropositivity to MERS-CoV when animals have active MERS-CoV infections . Expanded virological investigations of African DCs may lead to more seropositive animals and geographic areas in which humans may be at risk. It is possible that there are areas where humans already harbour MERS-CoV infections that have not been identified because of an absence of laboratory surveillance. Virological investigations of bats may lead to findings of ancestral viruses and viral 'missing links' and identifying any other animal sources of zoonotic spread is important to inform options for reducing human
How long after Infectious MERS-CoV added to DC <BM25> Infectious MERS-CoV added to DC, goat or cow milk and stored at 4°C could be recovered at least 72 h later and, if stored at 22°C, recovery was possible for up to 48 h . MERS-CoV titre decreased somewhat when recovered from milk at 22°C but pasteurization completely ablated MERS-CoV infectivity . In a subsequent study, MERS-CoV RNA was identified in the milk, nasal secretion and faeces of DCs from Qatar .
How long after Infectious MERS-CoV added to DC <BM25> Infectious MERS-CoV added to DC, goat or cow milk and stored at 4°C could be recovered at least 72 h later and, if stored at 22°C, recovery was possible for up to 48 h . MERS-CoV titre decreased somewhat when recovered from milk at 22°C but pasteurization completely ablated MERS-CoV infectivity . In a subsequent study, MERS-CoV RNA was identified in the milk, nasal secretion and faeces of DCs from Qatar .
What ablated MERS-COV infection completely? <BM25> large size of the ablated lesion with a corresponding inadequate tumor kill. Local RFA failure, however, could not be completely attributed to the size of the lesion ablated as the other 4 patients had tumors Յ3 cm.
How long MERS-CoV remained viable at high ambient temperature (30°C) and low RH (30 %) ? <BM25> A single study has examined the ability of MERS-CoV to survive in the environment . Plastic or steel surfaces were inoculated with 10 6 TCID 50 of MERS-CoV at different temperature and relative humidity and virus recovery was attempted in cell culture. At high ambient temperature and low RH MERS-CoV remained viable for 24 h . By comparison, a well known and efficently transmitted respiratory virus, influenza A virus, could not be recovered in culture beyond four hours under any conditions . Aerosol experiments found MERS-CoV viability only decreased 7 % at low RH at 20°C. In comparison, influenza A
How long can pathogenic bacteria remain viable and airborne in a coughed aerosol? <BM25> virus decreased by 95 % . MERS-CoV survival is inferior to that previously demonstrated for SARS-CoV . For context, pathogenic bacteria can remain viable and airborne for 45 min in a coughed aerosol and can spread 4 m. MERS-CoV's ability to remain viable over long time periods gives it the capacity to thoroughly contaminate a room's surfaces when occupied by an infected and symptomatic patient . Whether MERS-CoV can remain adrift and infectious for extended periods remains unknown. Such findings expand our understanding of the possibilities for droplets to transmit respiratory viruses in many settings, including hospital waiting rooms, emergency
How far can pathogenic bacteria spread in a coughed aerosol? <BM25> virus decreased by 95 % . MERS-CoV survival is inferior to that previously demonstrated for SARS-CoV . For context, pathogenic bacteria can remain viable and airborne for 45 min in a coughed aerosol and can spread 4 m. MERS-CoV's ability to remain viable over long time periods gives it the capacity to thoroughly contaminate a room's surfaces when occupied by an infected and symptomatic patient . Whether MERS-CoV can remain adrift and infectious for extended periods remains unknown.

What is considered the mechanism of human-to-human transmission of MERS-COV? <BM25> susceptibles than its counterpart having a direct transmission mechanism.
What is the transmission of MERS-CoV is defined as? <BM25> Assuming that all individuals mix homogeneously, then the transmission model defined earlier by equation is generalised to
What is the  the rate of general transmission <BM25> Throughout this paper, we let be a complete probability space with a filtration {F t } t≥0 satisfying the usual conditions , and we denote R 3 + = x ∈ R 3 : x i > 0, i = 1, 2, 3 . If the transmission of the infection is governed by a general nonlinear incidence rate βSG, then the basic SIRS model with variable population size is
What do the majority of human cases of MERS-CoV  seem not to do? <BM25> to recover in majority of cases .
What is the basic reproduction number (R 0)? <BM25> known basic reproduction number R 0 .
What is the basic reproduction number (R 0 )  for MERS-COV? <BM25> known basic reproduction number R 0 .
Why has MERS had a constant presence in the Arabian Peninsula? <BM25> tracing, limited community testing and how a case is defined. That MERS has had a constant presence in the Arabian Peninsula since 2012 is due to ongoing, sporadic spill-over events from DCs amplified by poorly controlled hospital outbreaks.
What was the first known MERS human-to-human transmission event was one characterized by? <BM25> The first known MERS human-to-human transmission event was one characterized by acute LRT disease in a healthcare setting in Jordan. In stark contrast, a sero-survey of HCW who were sometimes in close and prolonged contact with the first, fatal MERS-CoV case in 2012 , found none of the HCW had seroconverted four months later, despite an absence of eye protection and variable compliance with required PPE standards .
Where was the first known MERS human-to-human transmission event? <BM25> The first known MERS human-to-human transmission event was one characterized by acute LRT disease in a healthcare setting in Jordan. In stark contrast, a sero-survey of HCW who were sometimes in close and prolonged contact with the first, fatal MERS-CoV case in 2012 , found none of the HCW had seroconverted four months later, despite an absence of eye protection and variable compliance with required PPE standards .
Approximately what percentage of MERS cases were fatal in  KSA? <BM25> The proportion of fatal MERS cases within the KSA compared to outside the KSA, as well as the age, and sex distribution change in different ways when comparing MERS outbreaks. Approximately 43 % of MERS cases in the KSA were fatal betwen 2012 and December 2015 while 21 % died among those occurring outside of the KSA. The total number of male cases always outnumber females and the proportion of male deaths is always greater than the proportion of females who die. However the proportion of male deaths from total males with MERS is a similar figure to that for
Approximately what percentage of MERS cases were died outside KSA? <BM25> The proportion of fatal MERS cases within the KSA compared to outside the KSA, as well as the age, and sex distribution change in different ways when comparing MERS outbreaks. Approximately 43 % of MERS cases in the KSA were fatal betwen 2012 and December 2015 while 21 % died among those occurring outside of the KSA. The total number of male cases always outnumber females and the proportion of male deaths is always greater than the proportion of females who die. However the proportion of male deaths from total males with MERS is a similar figure to that for
What percentage of HCWs comprised of MERS cases in the KSA and South Korea? <BM25> As a group, HCWs comprised 16 % of MERS cases in the KSA and South Korea. It is apparent that the weekly proportion of infected HCWs increases alongside each steep rise in overall detections . In May 2013, the WHO published guidelines for IPC during care of probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in a healthcare setting . This is explainable because to date, each case rise has been intimately associated with healthcare-facility related outbreaks . These rises in MERS-CoV detections can decrease the average age during each event because HCWs are usually younger than inpatients with MERS. Healthcare
How has most of the analysis of MERS-CoV genetics  been performed? <BM25> performed in SAS/ GENETICS using the PROC HAPLOTYPE procedure.
What does Clade A contain? <BM25> of the dISF clade encompassing ILOV, CHAOV, LAMV and DONV contain a functionally utilized -1 PRF site towards the 3' end of the region encoding NS2B.
What does clade B comprise? <BM25> comprise CNS myelin.
How many clades have become apparent in genome of  MERS-COV from humans and DCs? <BM25> characterization . As more genomes from both humans and DCs have been characterized, two clades have become apparent; A and B . Clade A contains only human-derived MERS-CoV genomes from Jordan, while Clade B comprises the majority of human and camel genomes deduced thus far .
Which city has had has had more MERS cases than any other region of the KSA ? <BM25> In Jeddah between March and July 2014 , there was a rapid increase in MERS cases, accompanied by intense screening; approximately 5,000 samples from in and around the region were tested in a month yielding around 140 MERS-CoV detections . Among 5,065 individuals sampled and tested across the KSA between October 2012 and September 2013,108 detections were made in a hospital-centric population which included hospitalized cases , their families and associated HCWs . Among the detections, 19 were HCWs and 10 were family contacts .
Which city harbours a wide range of MERS-CoV variants <BM25> been rare . In Riyadh-2014, genetic evidence supported the likelihood of multiple external introductions of virus, implicating a range of healthcare facilities in an event that otherwise looked contiguous . Riyadh is a nexus for camel and human travel and has had more MERS cases than any other region of the KSA to date but also harbours a wide range of MERS-CoV variants . However the South Korean outbreak originated from a single infected person, resulting in three to four generations of cases . Studies of this apparently recombinant viral variant did not find an increased evolutionary rate and no
How has the vast majority of MERS-CoV transmission occurred? <BM25> Because few sequences were obtained from Northeast and Northwest China, to avoid bias, the data of these two regions are not shown. according to geographic distribution, a vast majority of the sequences were from the developed regions , whereas far fewer sequences were from the undeveloped regions, especially from the national border provinces. HFMD is a serious public health threat not only to China, but also to other Asia countries . In particular, some large HFMD outbreaks occurred in recent years in the neighboring countries including Korea, Russia, Vietnam, and Cambodia. Moreover, a few studies have suggested a cross-border transmission
How were the transmission circumstances created? <BM25> There appears to be a 2-3 % prevalence of MERS-CoV in the KSA with a 5 % chance of secondary transmission within the household. There is an increased risk of infection through certain occupations at certain times and a much greater chance for spread to other humans during circumstances created by humans, which drives more effective transmission than any R 0 would predict on face value. Nonetheless, despite multiple mass gatherings that have afforded the virus many millions of opportunities to spread, there have remarkably been no reported outbreaks of MERS or MERS-CoV during or immediately after these events. There
What percentage of humans have died  among all humans reported to be infected? <BM25> We identified five studies that reported data on the smoking status of patients infected with COVID-19. Notably, in the largest study that assessed severity, there were higher percentages of current and former smokers among patients that needed ICU support, mechanical ventilation or who had died, and a higher percentage of smokers among the severe cases 12 . However, from their published data we can calculate that the smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to be admitted to an ICU, need mechanical ventilation or die compared to non-smokers .
What would  aid accurate calculation of a case fatality ratio? <BM25> Vigilance remains important for containment since MERS-CoV is a virus with a genetic makeup that has been observed for only three years and is not stable. Among all humans reported to be infected, nearly 40 % have died. Continued laboratory testing, sequencing, analysis, timely data sharing and clear communication are essential for such vigilance to be effective. Global alignment of case definitions would further aid accurate calculation of a case fatality ratio by including subclinical case numbers. Whole genome sequencing has been used extensively to study MERS-CoV travel and variation and although it remains a tool for experts, it appears
How does MARS-COV differ from SARS-COV? <BM25> did not differ.
Is there any evidence that MERS-CoV is a virus of pandemic concern? <BM25> is no evidence that MERS-CoV is a virus of pandemic concern. Nonetheless, hospital settings continue to describe MERS cases and outbreaks in the Arabian Peninsula. As long as we facilitate the spread of MERS-CoV among our most vulnerable populations, the world must remain on alert for cases which may be exported more frequently when a host country with infected camel reservoirs is experiencing human clusters or outbreaks.
How did the first WHO case definition  define probable cases of MERS? <BM25> The first WHO case definition defined probable cases of MERS based on the presence of febrile illness, cough and requirement for hospitalization with suspicion of lower respiratory tract involvement. It also included roles for contact with a probable or confirmed case or for travel or residence within the Arabian Peninsula. If strictly adhered to, only the severe syndrome would be subject to laboratory testing, which was the paradigm early on . From July 2013, the revised WHO case definition included the importance of seeking out and understanding the role of asymptomatic cases and from June 2014, the WHO definition more
What is PHEIC? <BM25> The 19-question, email-based survey was administered between 2 and 23 February 2016, immediately following the PHEIC declaration. A total of 28 surveys to national-level laboratories likely to be tasked with ZIKV testing were distributed to 19 countries in the Region .
How is PHEIC defined? <BM25> The role of a declaration of a PHEIC in managing a serious outbreak has been questioned in the light of Ebola in West Africa and in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has been challenged again with this outbreak. The binary nature of a PHEIC declaration and the specificity of the three defined criteria for a PHEIC have caused difficulty for Emergency Committees in considering whether a given event should be a PHEIC. The lack of a clear understanding of what a PHEIC declaration is meant to achieve adds to the Emergency Committee's difficulties, as does the relative paucity of
What platform was instrumental in rapid sharing of COVID-19 information? <BM25> With the world having experienced some notable influenza pandemics in the past, a Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data platform was established and was instrumental in the rapid sharing of information by the Chinese scientists regarding the emergence of the COVID-19 virus. Through this platform, scientists from other regions were observed to gain access to information and are, subsequently, able to act in a much faster capacity; like in the case of scientists from the Virus Identification Laboratory based at Doherty Institute, Australia, who managed to grow a similar virus in the laboratory after accessing the data shared by
What's the recommended procedure to disinfect at CT scanner after a COVID-19 exposure? <BM25> floor. 1 CT and 1 MR scanner are located in the third inpatient building. 1 CT and 1 MR scanner
What's the recommended method to disinfect floors for COVID-19? <BM25> The light fixtures and outdoor grills of ventilation vents and all horizontal surfaces should be cleaned with pre-moistened disposable cloths with a disinfectant FDA and Environmental Protection Agency approved. The design and selection of the furniture of a transplant program should be focused in creating and maintaining an environment: free of dust and the floors and finishes should be brushable, waterproof, easy to disinfect and antistatic .
What is the role of computed tomography (CT) in COVID-19? <BM25> CT: computed tomography
What kind of masks are recommended to protect healthcare workers from COVID-19 exposure? <BM25> Critically ill patients with known or suspected airborne, droplet, or contact infections require specific hygienic precautions. Although no randomized controlled trials were identified by our literature search, isolation of patients with airborne or droplet infections in separate rooms is recommended by international and national guidelines both in resource-rich and resource-limited settings . In addition to standard hygienic measures, adequate hand hygiene in particular, the use of masks has been recommended to protect healthcare workers caring for patients with acute respiratory infections. Despite surrogate exposure studies indicating that N95 respirators are associated with less filter penetration and inward leakage than surgical
What thickness of layers is recommended for CT image reconstruction in COVID-19 assessment? <BM25> On both scanners, image reconstruction included decaycorrection to the start of scanning and attenuation-correction based on CT scanning.
What must the data gathering include? <BM25> Issues to consider when creating a case management process during a mass gathering will include the following:
What must be done to assist in recognition of the disease on images and to allow accurate reporting of these findings? <BM25> all radiologists to assist in recognition of the disease on images and to allow accurate reporting
What is the major role of chest CT? <BM25> helpful for making the diagnosis. In our opinion, the major role of chest CT is to understand the
What is the reason to adopt low-dose CT? <BM25> Other lentiviral fusion proteins also have long CTs that are predicted to form multiple amphipathic helical segments, such as those from EIAV, MVV, and CAEV 17,18,44 . Whether these viral proteins adopt the unusual membrane-proximal fold seen for the HIV-1 Env CT remains to be investigated. Nevertheless, a trimeric baseplate of the CT together with the TMD appears to pose for specific interactions with the trimeric matrix protein , in the context of membrane.
What did the EMICT responsibilities include? <BM25> The radiology department director chaired the EMICT. Its members include the deputy
How were the radiology department areas divided? <BM25> The radiology department was divided into four areas : contaminated, semicontaminated,
How was the contaminated area connected to the CT room and other facilities? <BM25> buffer, and clean areas . The contaminated area is connected to the fever clinic and
What does the clean area include? <BM25> symptoms of COVID-19. Pregnant staff must be assigned to the clean area.

How was the wearing and removing of the equipment performed? <BM25> would be wearing cumbersome personal protective equipment .
What can lower the physical and mental stress levels of staff members? <BM25> pressure, periodically taking time off could lower their physical and mental stress levels. The
Who must be assigned to the clean area? <BM25> symptoms of COVID-19. Pregnant staff must be assigned to the clean area.
What responses must EMICT consider once a disease has been identified? <BM25> Once a contagious infectious disease has been identified, the EMICT must consider four
What is the conclusion of the report? <BM25> A conclusion of this report is the prediction of a slowing of Rt in response to major interventions. To
What were the number of cases in mainland china as of March 11th? <BM25> of February 2014, the number of confirmed H7N9 human cases in Mainland China doubled the numbers reported in the first wave outbreak between March and May, 2013 .
How many COVID deaths occurred in Chinese mainland as of March 11th? <BM25> of 80,793 confirmed cases and 3,169 deaths on the Chinese mainland. There remain 14,831
How many people have come in contact and how many of these are in observation? <BM25> As a second robustness check we use an additional cut of our data that includes observed repeated contacts. In some instances members of the hospital population were observed to have come in contact more than once during the observation period. We use this data as one way to include the weighting of contacts mentioned above into the analysis. Table 6 displays the observed contacts that were observed and had occurred previously in our data. As you see in the table many of these contacts involved repeated interactions with patients . We re-perform the analysis above with these additional contacts added
When was the novel Coronavirus first reported? <BM25> novel coronavirus that was first reported in Wuhan, China, on December 31, 2019, and that
When did China detect the first human case of H7N9 infection? <BM25> Since the case of human infection with avian influenza A H7N9 was first reported in 2013 in China , many more cases of this disease have emerged in this country . Human infection with avian influenza A H7N9 is a kind of acute respiratory disease which is caused by avian influenza A H7N9 virus, with more than 90% of the infected patients presenting with rapidly progressive pneumonia and 70% of them presenting with acute respiratory distress syndrome . The mortality is as high as 30% .
How many deaths were associated with MERS-CoV as of July 2014? <BM25> health challenge, occurred in 2009 due to the emergence of an A/ H1N1 pandemic IAV . The H1N1pdm virus has been detected in more than 214 countries and territories and has caused 18,389 deaths as of July 30, 2010 .
What illness is caused by the 2019-nCOV Coronavirus? <BM25> CDC is responding to a pandemic of respiratory disease spreading from person-to-person caused by a novel coronavirus. The disease has been named “coronavirus disease 2019” . This situation poses a serious public health risk. The federal government is working closely with state, local, tribal, and territorial partners, as well as public health partners, to respond to this situation. COVID-19 can cause mild to severe illness; most severe illness occurs in older adults.
In addition to oral swabs <BM25> FMDV and has successfully identified the FMDV genome and beta actin mRNA from several sources of infected nasal and oral swabs, as well as probang samples . In addition to extensive testing of vesicular epithelium samples, the performance of rRT-PCR has recently been assessed on milk and "probang" samples . Automated real-time RT-PCR has been compared with VI and antigen-detection ELISA with result being more positive by real-time PCR indicating that the real-time PCR has higher sensitivity than VI for the detection of FMDV in epithelial samples .
What  is the relationship between the presence of virus in blood and anal swabs and disease severity? <BM25> Abstract: The novel coronavirus infection caused pneumonia. we retrospectively analyzed the virus presence in the pharyngeal swab, blood, and the anal swab detected by real-time PCR in the clinical lab. Unexpectedly, the 2109-nCoV RNA was readily detected in the blood and the anal swabs . Importantly, all of the 6 patients with detectable viral RNA in the blood cohort progressed to severe symptom stage, indicating a strong correlation of serum viral RNA with the disease severity . Meanwhile, 8 of the 11 patients with annal swab virus-positive was in severe clinical stage. However, the concentration of viral RNA in the
Which patients were classified as severe in Chinese guidelines? <BM25> Each infant's condition was classified as mild, moderate or severe according to a severity score calculated from SpO2, respiratory rate, and respiratory effort on admission. 12 Patients were admitted to hospital on the basis of French national guidelines. 13 Infants who did not require hospitalization were cared for at home.
What is the relationship between the presence of virus in blood sample and disease severity? <BM25> Our study, however, had several limitations. There were only 2 patients in this study. We have not demonstrated the relationship between the severity of disease and the presence of mutations.
What test could give an indication for special care for 2019-nCOV patients? <BM25> indication of the optimal LOD . Even relatively high fluorescence thresholds do not give indications of the optimal cut-point .
What is the relationship between the presence of virus in anal swabs and disease severity in 2019-nCOV? <BM25> Abstract: The novel coronavirus infection caused pneumonia. we retrospectively analyzed the virus presence in the pharyngeal swab, blood, and the anal swab detected by real-time PCR in the clinical lab. Unexpectedly, the 2109-nCoV RNA was readily detected in the blood and the anal swabs . Importantly, all of the 6 patients with detectable viral RNA in the blood cohort progressed to severe symptom stage, indicating a strong correlation of serum viral RNA with the disease severity .

What  could account for the high transmission rate of the 2019-nCOV virus? <BM25> infected, but the number of infected are few. However, if a virus like Nipah, that is a virus that has a high fatality rate and already has demonstrated competency for person-to-person transmission, were to develop an enhanced capacity for person-to-person transmission, it could present a global catastrophic biological risk.
What could account for the dissemination of the 2019-nCOV virus across the whole body? <BM25> the viral spike protein might confer favourable interaction with human ACE2 . Of note, ACE2 is also abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the small intestine besides the respiratory tract and is ubiquitously present in endothelial cells , which might provide possible routes of transmission, and might account for the high transmission capacity of the new virus. We propose that rampant coronavirus replication in pulmonary alveolus results in the breakdown of the alveolar vessel and the subsequent virus leakage into the blood flow, through which the virus is disseminated across the whole body. Then the virus succeeds in

What is the mechanism of action for rupintrivir? <BM25> unique mechanism of action and also deserves further study.
Has rupintrivir been shown to reduce the symptoms of a rhinoviral infection? <BM25> Rupintrivir was initially designed as an inhibitor of rhinoviral 3C protease. Later it demonstrated antiviral activity toward other representatives of the family Picornaviridae. Derivatives of this preparation were also able to inhibit enteroviruses EV A71 and CV A16 .
What is the primary etiology of acute respiratory infection? <BM25> studies in which CMV disease was sought as etiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome or ventilator-associated pneumonia . Considering that CMV disease is a distinct entity with worse outcomes than CMV infection, the data from these studies were summarized separately.
What is RSV? <BM25> RSV .
What virus is most commonly associated with acute respiratory infections? <BM25> Parainfluenza viruses are a major cause of croup , bronchiolitis, and pneumonia as well as upper respiratory tract infections. Of the 4 antigenically distinct types, types 1 and 2 are most commonly associated with croup syndrome, while type 3 is associated most commonly with bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Parainfluenza virus infections account for up to 11% of all hospitalizations in children <5 years old .
What viruses are most frequently associated with acute respiratory infections? <BM25> A total of 170 cDNA samples tested positive for HPIV . Of these, 90 patient samples tested positive for only a single HPIV species while 11 were co-infections of two HPIV species; HPIV2 and HPIV3 , HPIV2 and HPIV4 , HPIV3 and HPIV4 . The remaining 69 HPIV-positive samples also tested positive for other respiratory viruses. In general, HPIV3 and HPIV4 were more commonly associated with viral co-infections, with Rhinovirus/Enterovirus most frequently co-detected, being present in 47 of 170 of HPIV infections. Notably, bocavirus was found as a co-infection with each HPIV species, and was found in 15 of 170
What are the clinical characteristics of asthma? <BM25> We describe epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with asthma hospitalized with pH1N1 infection in the U.S. during the spring and fall of 2009.
What risk factor was associated with hospitalization and death during the 2009 H1N1 influence pandemic? <BM25> case had three risk factors. Age under 5 y was the most common risk factor for hospitalization due to pandemic influenza A . Malignant tumor , asthma and congenital heart disease were the next most common risk factors.
How many surface proteins are on the H1N1 influenza virus? <BM25> one can produce VSV pseudotyped with influenza surface proteins, which lack entry-glycoproteins in its resident genome, rendering the second generation of virus infection-incompetent .
What are the 2 surface proteins on the H1N1 influenza virus? <BM25> one can produce VSV pseudotyped with influenza surface proteins, which lack entry-glycoproteins in its resident genome, rendering the second generation of virus infection-incompetent .
What pharmaceutical targets the NA glycoprotein of the H1N1 influenza virus? <BM25> is standardized, but the concentration of NA glycoprotein is not standardized. The role of cell-mediated immunity in the control of avian influenza virus infections is not known. A potential advantage of a vaccine that induces a cell-mediated immune response, over one that elicits a protective antibody response, is that the internal proteins of the virus that are targets of the cell-mediated immune response tend to be conserved and are less prone to genetic drift than are the antibody-binding sites on the HA and NA glycoproteins.
What genetic mutation decreases a person's susceptibility to the H1N1 influenza virus? <BM25> Clearly, the identification of host genetic factors that modulate the susceptibility to and the severity of influenza virus infection is of paramount importance to develop preventive strategies and therapeutic interventions.
Why is ribavirin treatment limited? <BM25> assay, and ribavirin was the positive control in after infection treatment.
To what the lack of exposure report could be attributed? <BM25> In our study, we found that only 20% of the participants felt that they are well trained to provide nursing care to the patients with maxillofacial injuries. This may be attributed to a lack of training to the nurses in this area as well as exposure to these types of injuries.
Why is the determination of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic transmission <BM25> role of other modes of transmission, e.g., environmental and asymptomatic transmissions, should be further explored.
When does the infectivity of SARS-COV peak? <BM25> showed a sharp peak at a density of 1.19 g/ml coinciding with a peak of the infectivity.
How can the 2019-nCov spread? <BM25> to spread.
What is the estimate of the basic reproduction number? <BM25> Using Eq and z 2 z 1 ¼ X k i¼1 nðiÞzðiÞ n we estimate λ. The basic reproduction number from model B can then be obtained numerically by using Eq .
What is assumed for the mean serial interval? <BM25> assumed a gamma distribution for the serial interval, and have considered a range of values for both the reproduction number and the mean serial interval.
What  would a shorter mean serial interval mean? <BM25> distribution and the initial growth rate of observed deaths. A shorter assumed serial interval results in
What should have reduced the basic reproduction number in January? <BM25> with an estimated basic reproduction number of 2.2 to 3.6 .
What  are the delays between infection to illness and illness to laboratory confirmatiion? <BM25> because cases currently being detected and reported would have mostly been infected in mid- to late-January. Average delays between infection and illness onset have been estimated at around 5–6 days, with an upper limit of around 11-14 days , and delays from illness onset to laboratory confirmation added a further 10 days on average .
What is the estimate of number of infections in Wuhan on 25 January 2020? <BM25> Temporal distribution of the number of new infections. Our goal was to treat all laboratory-confirmed cases between January 2013 and June 2017 as a sample with number N, and to use this sample to estimate the temporal distribution for the growth rate of new infections.
when is viral shedding the highest? <BM25> due to higher viral loads and prolonged viral shedding .
How does the transmission of the respiratory virus happen? <BM25> transmission of virus by respiratory droplets.
How do some respiratory viruses spread? <BM25> study. Possibly a respiratory mode of spread for rotavirus infection will be documented, or perhaps a synergistic effect between rotavirus and respiratory viruses will be found.
What can also play  a role? <BM25> that V would also play a role in viral RNA synthesis.
What can play a role  in the infection of gastrointestinal tract? <BM25> out of the gastrointestinal tract.
What was attributed to the spread of SARS-COV at Amoy Gardens? <BM25> Transmission of respiratory viruses generally happens through large respiratory droplets, but some respiratory viruses can spread through fine particle aerosols , and indirect transmission via fomites can also play a role. Coronaviruses can also infect the human gastrointestinal tract , and faecal-oral transmission might also play a role in this instance. The SARS-CoV superspreading event at Amoy Gardens where more than 300 cases were infected was attributed to faecal-oral, then airborne, spread through pressure differentials between contaminated effluent pipes, bathroom floor drains and flushing toilets . The first large identifiable superspreading event during the present 2019-nCoV outbreak has apparently taken
How were the first human infections identified? <BM25> Sabia virus has caused a single natural human infection that was fatal, and also two none fatal laboratory infections . No reservoir host has yet been identified.
What do mild clinical presentations of 2019-nCOV indicate? <BM25> differing clinical presentations from those traditionally attributed to HRV.
Why is important to  determine the spectrum of clinical manifestations of 2019-nCoV infections? <BM25> suggest that the mutant spectrum plays an important role in begomovirus infections in each host.
What <BM25> it. Aiming at this moving target will require out-of-the-box thinking and interdisciplinary collaboration.
For whom would the infections be more severe? <BM25> would then be a "secondary-like", clinically more severe dengue illness. It is not the vaccine itself that causes excess cases, but rather the vaccine's induction of an immune status that increases the risk that subsequent infections will be more severe.
When is this especially true? <BM25> . This is especially true of arginines, such as Arg241 and Arg252 in PAH .
What is the current understanding on viral-induced exacerbations? <BM25> of both the efficacy of current and novel intervention strategies and unresponsiveness to these strategies in some treated individuals, thereby leading to a clearer and more comprehensive understanding of asthma exacerbations and how to prevent and treat them.
What have evoked new understandings as to the mechanisms of viral exacerbations? <BM25> Abstract: Respiratory virus infection is one of the major sources of exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. These exacerbations are associated with high morbidity and even mortality worldwide. The current understanding on viral-induced exacerbations is that viral infection increases airway inflammation which aggravates disease symptoms. Recent advances in in vitro air-liquid interface 3D cultures, organoid cultures and the use of novel human and animal challenge models have evoked new understandings as to the mechanisms of viral exacerbations. In this review, we will focus on recent novel findings that elucidate how respiratory viral infections alter the epithelial barrier in the airways,
What is one of  the major sources of exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases? <BM25> As RV, RSV, and IFV were the most frequently studied viruses in chronic airway inflammatory diseases, most of the viruses listed are predominantly these viruses. However, the mechanisms stated here may also be applicable to other viruses but may not be listed as they were not implicated in the context of chronic airway inflammatory diseases exacerbation .
What is the focus of this review? <BM25> focus of attention in this review.
What have the authors reviewed? <BM25> for outbreak pathogens. All authors reviewed, edited and approved the final version of the manuscript.
What is summarized? <BM25> summarized in Table S4 .

What is consolidated in this review? <BM25> Single or multiple solid nodules or consolidated nodules in the center of lobule, surrounded by ground-glass opacities .
What is this disease  characterized by ? <BM25> on the clinical picture characterized by the development of gastrointestinal signs followed by neurological signs at the final stage of disease.
Where can this disease manifest? <BM25> Border disease is a congenital disease of sheep and clinical disease is usually manifest at lambing time. Occasionally, however, enteric disease can be associated with pesfivirus infection.
Why do treatment and management vary in efficacy? <BM25> These findings confirm the clinical safety and efficacy of Optivate Ò in both the prophylactic management and on-demand treatment of bleeds in patients with severe haemophilia A. Furthermore, no concerns emerged regarding FVIII inhibitors.
What complicates this  further? <BM25> sisted for over 5 hours . Almost in 5% of 12 million people receiving heparin therapy heparin induced thrombocytopenia is developed after one year and this is the reason for cessation of the heparin therapy. Patients who need repeated anticoagulant therapy receive hemodialysis, which complicates patient's life.
What are such exacerbations due to? <BM25> IFN-γ in group D were significantly higher than in group C. Conclusions: Infection-induced asthma exacerbations may be due to impaired anti-viral Th1-immune responses. There appears to be a critical window of 3-5 days for therapeutic intervention.
What do the acute exacerbations cause? <BM25> We observed a significant reduction in antibiotic use in patients hospitalized with severe acute exacerbations of asthma for whom a decision could be made on the basis of an algorithm of PCT measurements. Importantly, withholding antibiotic treatment did not cause apparent harm according to clinical and laboratory outcomes at discharge and during the 12-month follow-up period.
What are acute exacerbations  usually due to ? <BM25> IFV, usually result in severe acute exacerbations with non-classical symptoms of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Fortunately, annual vaccines are available to prevent IFV infections ; and it is recommended that patients with chronic airway inflammatory disease receive their annual influenza vaccination as the best means to prevent severe IFV induced exacerbation.
What does the immune response elicited by these agents lead to? <BM25> the NOD-like receptor or the NF-kappa B signaling pathway was gradually down-regulated . These data suggest that there is a clear activation response elicited from the immune response system during the EV71 infectious process. Nevertheless, whether such a transcriptional immune response could lead to the pathogenesis observed ater EV71 infection remains largely unknown in the light of quantitative evaluation.
Among these agents which is a major driver? <BM25> The association between age at first major whooping cough outbreak and PD constitutes an important observation in Iceland, reinforced by negative results for birth-cohort effects in continental populations. Considered as a quasi-experiment, it is consistent with the high prevalence and incidence of PD among the Faroe Islanders and Greenland Inuit with MSA, LBD, and AD, BP infection in genetically susceptible young individuals might be proposed as an environmental driver for late-life sCNDD such as MSA, PD, LBD, AD, and AMD.
What is the viral involvement in COPD exacerbation? <BM25> COPD patients were classified according to GOLD guidelines Patients with acute exacerbation or known viral/bacterial infection were excluded. Tissue donor characteristics are displayed in Table 1 .
What is the reason for the involvement of respiratory viruses in exacerbation? <BM25> Corticosteroids have proven benefits in the treatment of acute exacerbation of COPD and the presence of chronic respiratory disease is the main reason for adding corticosteroids to antimicrobial treatment in pneumonia .
What does the involvement of respiratory viruses contribute to? <BM25> inflammatory nature of these diseases . One of the reasons for the involvement of respiratory viruses' in exacerbations is their ease of transmission and infection . In addition, the high diversity of the respiratory viruses may also contribute to exacerbations of different nature and severity . Hence, it is important to identify the exact mechanisms underpinning viral exacerbations in susceptible subjects in order to properly manage exacerbations via supplementary treatments that may alleviate the exacerbation symptoms or prevent severe exacerbations.
Why is it  important to identify the exact mechanisms underpinning viral exacerbations in susceptible subjects? <BM25> inflammatory nature of these diseases . One of the reasons for the involvement of respiratory viruses' in exacerbations is their ease of transmission and infection . In addition, the high diversity of the respiratory viruses may also contribute to exacerbations of different nature and severity . Hence, it is important to identify the exact mechanisms underpinning viral exacerbations in susceptible subjects in order to properly manage exacerbations via supplementary treatments that may alleviate the exacerbation symptoms or prevent severe exacerbations.
What is the lower airway the site of? <BM25> an effective immune response to the infection in the upper airway and nasal cavity, without risking pathogenesis from a lower airway infection, which is the site of the most significant sequelae of influenza infection .
Where is the the first point of contact with sources of exacerbation <BM25> While the lower airway is the site of dysregulated inflammation in most chronic airway inflammatory diseases, the upper airway remains the first point of contact with sources of exacerbation. Therefore, their interaction with the exacerbation agents may directly contribute to the subsequent responses in the lower airway, in line with the "United Airway" hypothesis. To elucidate the host airway interaction with viruses leading to exacerbations, we thus focus our review on recent findings of viral interaction with the upper airway. We compiled how viral induced changes to the upper airway may contribute to chronic airway inflammatory disease exacerbations, to provide
What is complied by the authors? <BM25> and complied with routine practice at the study institution.
Before linking respiratory viruses <BM25> non-First Nations. A constant annual pattern has been reported, linking the contributing factors, habitual smoking, and obesity to respiratory illnesses.
What did the advent of PCR technology lead to? <BM25> real and informative associations with disease before the advent of genome-wide genotyping technology . We focus here on larger studies, those that have been replicated, and studies with particular relevance to the pathogenesis of severe IAV.
What are the predominant viruses linked to airway inflammatory diseases? <BM25> Despite being a major cause of exacerbation, reports linking respiratory viruses to acute exacerbations only start to emerge in the late 1950s ; with bacterial infections previously considered as the likely culprit for acute exacerbation . However, with the advent of PCR technology, more viruses were recovered during acute exacerbations events and reports implicating their role emerged in the late 1980s . Rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus are the predominant viruses linked to the development and exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases . Other viruses such as parainfluenza virus , influenza virus and adenovirus have also been implicated in acute
What other viruses are implicated in acute exacerbations but to a much lesser extent? <BM25> exacerbations but to a much lesser extent .

What other viruses have been recently reported as contributing to acute exacerbations? <BM25> exacerbations but to a much lesser extent . More recently, other viruses including bocavirus , human metapneumovirus , certain coronavirus strains, a specific enterovirus strain EV-D68, human cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus have been reported as contributing to acute exacerbations .

Where do the respiratory viruses primarily infect and replicate? <BM25> Respiratory viruses primarily infect and replicate within airway epithelial cells . During the replication process, the cells release antiviral factors and cytokines that alter local airway inflammation and airway niche . In a healthy airway, the inflammation normally leads to type 1 inflammatory responses consisting of activation of an antiviral state and infiltration of antiviral effector cells. This eventually results in the resolution of the inflammatory response and clearance of the viral infection . However, in a chronically inflamed airway, the responses against the virus may be impaired or aberrant, causing sustained inflammation and erroneous infiltration, resulting in the exacerbation

What additional effects are caused  in patients with asthma and patients with CRS with nasal polyp ? <BM25> Additionally, in patients with asthma and patients with CRS with nasal polyp , viral infections such as RV and RSV promote a Type 2-biased immune response . This amplifies the basal type 2 inflammation resulting in a greater release of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, RANTES and eotaxin and a further increase in eosinophilia, a key pathological driver of asthma and CRSwNP . Increased eosinophilia, in turn, worsens the classical symptoms of disease and may further lead to life-threatening conditions due to breathing difficulties. On the other hand, patients with COPD and patients with CRS without nasal polyp are more neutrophilic in

This amplifies the basal type 2 inflammation resulting in a greater release of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, RANTES and eotaxin and a further increase in eosinophilia, a key pathological driver of asthma and CRSwNP . Increased eosinophilia, in turn, worsens the classical symptoms of disease and may further lead to life-threatening conditions due to breathing difficulties. On the other hand, patients with COPD and patients with CRS without nasal polyp are more neutrophilic in
Which are the type 2 inflammatory cytokines expressed by the epithelial cells upon injury to the epithelial barrier? <BM25> An epithelial-centric alarmin pathway around IL-25, IL-33 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin , and their interaction with group 2 innate lymphoid cells has also recently been identified . IL-25, IL-33 and TSLP are type 2 inflammatory cytokines expressed by the epithelial cells upon injury to the epithelial barrier .

What happens when the 3 cytokines are expressed? <BM25> contains 16 Ig-like C2-type extracellular domains that separate the ligand-binding site from the cell surface, it is available for interaction with external ligands and not bound in cis to cell-surface molecules, which is what usually happens with shorter Siglecs that are also expressed by DCs .
What  happens in the case of COPD? <BM25> susceptible, nothing happens and the state of the network remains unchanged. In that case the time step is wasted.

Why viruses do not need to directly infect the lower airway to cause an acute exacerbation? <BM25> 09 virus could infect the epithelia of the lower airway and cause viral pneumonia in mice.
what is suggested by the fact that  not all viral infections of the airway lead to acute exacerbations? <BM25> Bronchial epithelial cells are the main target of rhinovirus infection, which is the most frequent cause of common cold as well as exacerbation in patients with asthma and COPD . Exacerbations are the main cause of disease severity and progression infection correlates with the seasonal frequency of exacerbations in asthma and COPD patients and it was suggested that preventive measures reducing viral infection would benefit these patients . EPs 7630, a proprietary aqueous-ethanolic extract from Pelargonium sidoides roots, has been shown to shorten viral infections. It is widely used in the treatment of acute airway infections and has been investigated

Why should future studies  be performed using metagenomics in addition to PCR analysis ? <BM25> alter the local environment and contribute to current and future exacerbations. Future studies should be performed using metagenomics in addition to PCR analysis to determine the contribution of the microbiome and mycobiome to viral infections. In this review, we highlight recent data regarding viral interactions with the airway epithelium that could also contribute to, or further aggravate, acute exacerbations of chronic airway inflammatory diseases.
What is highlighted by the authors in this review? <BM25> review and revision of manuscript; All authors read and approved the final manuscript.
Who has impaired or reduced ability of viral clearance ? <BM25> Patients with chronic airway inflammatory diseases have impaired or reduced ability of viral clearance . Their impairment stems from a type 2-skewed inflammatory response which deprives the airway of important type 1 responsive CD8 cells that are responsible for the complete clearance of virusinfected cells . This is especially evident in weak type 1 inflammation-inducing viruses such as RV and RSV . Additionally, there are also evidence of reduced type I and III interferon production due to type 2-skewed inflammation, which contributes to imperfect clearance of the virus resulting in persistence of viral components, or the live virus in the
What does their impairment stems from? <BM25> The idea that reduced generation of CTL specific for MV and HSV may reflect a generalized impairment in CD4 + T-cell function stems from the observation that both MV as well as HSV induce an immune response that appears to be predominantly restricted by HLA class II-restricted CTL. Such CTL are thought to be primarily mediated by CD4 + T-cells. Reduced CD4 + T-cell-mediated CTL in MS is intriguing insofar as MS patients have been repeatedly shown to generate elevated amounts of antibody to multiple viruses . The generation of such antibody is also dependent upon CD4 + T-cells .
Where is this  especially evident? <BM25> peptides contain IFN-ω peptides from animals of different Genus/Family, such as that of the ungulatemix and the RBH-mix clusters . In contrast to the potential evolutionary progenitor shared in mammalian species, IFN-ω genes undergo reduction or expansion independently in each animal species, which are especially evident, such as IFN-ω gene expansion in swine and bovine species .
What are other  effects? <BM25> effects.
What is the  effect of viral components remaining in the airway? <BM25> remaining infectious viral particles when compared to uncoupled SCR1920 . The control groups, 48scFvSCR1112 and CtlrscFvSCR1920, exhibited no beneficial effect on virolysis in a 2-fold ratio to FH .
What do these factors do? <BM25> and other factors .
What is also linked with the chronic inflammation that precedes the malignancies? <BM25> with the chronic inflammation that precedes the malignancies . Therefore, the role of HPV infection in causing chronic inflammation in the airway and their association to exacerbations of chronic airway inflammatory diseases, which is scarcely explored, should be investigated in the future. Furthermore, viral persistence which lead to continuous expression of antiviral genes may also lead to the development of steroid resistance, which is seen with RV, RSV, and PIV infection . The use of steroid to suppress the inflammation may also cause the virus to linger longer in the airway due to the lack of antiviral clearance . The
What should be investigated in the future? <BM25> be investigated in future studies.
What further can viral persistence lead to? <BM25> and TLR pathways, failed to clear CW3 . Thus, global defects in induction of IFN lead to viral persistence.
What  effect the use of steroids to  suppress inflammation can have? <BM25> suppress inflammation.
What should be further focus of research? <BM25> focus on the resources and tools that are most relevant to pathogen genome research.
Which viruses may not cause prolonged inflammation due to strong induction of antiviral clearance? <BM25> On the other end of the spectrum, viruses that induce strong type 1 inflammation and cell death such as IFV and certain CoV , may not cause prolonged inflammation due to strong induction of antiviral clearance. These infections, however, cause massive damage and cell death to the epithelial barrier, so much so that areas of the epithelium may be completely absent post infection . Factors such as RANTES and CXCL10, which recruit immune cells to induce apoptosis, are strongly induced from IFV infected epithelium . Additionally, necroptotic factors such as RIP3 further compounds the cell deaths in IFV infected epithelium
What do these infections cause? <BM25> tuberculosis. These infections rapidly cause death if untreated.
What do the necroptotic factors such as RIP3 do? <BM25> On the other end of the spectrum, viruses that induce strong type 1 inflammation and cell death such as IFV and certain CoV , may not cause prolonged inflammation due to strong induction of antiviral clearance. These infections, however, cause massive damage and cell death to the epithelial barrier, so much so that areas of the epithelium may be completely absent post infection . Factors such as RANTES and CXCL10, which recruit immune cells to induce apoptosis, are strongly induced from IFV infected epithelium . Additionally, necroptotic factors such as RIP3 further compounds the cell deaths in IFV infected epithelium
What  may the destruction of the epithelial barrier  cause? <BM25> . The massive cell death induced may result in worsening of the acute exacerbation due to the release of their cellular content into the airway, further evoking an inflammatory response in the airway . Moreover, the destruction of the epithelial barrier may cause further contact with other pathogens and allergens in the airway which may then prolong exacerbations or results in new exacerbations. Epithelial destruction may also promote further epithelial remodeling during its regeneration as viral infection induces the expression of remodeling genes such as MMPs and growth factors . Infections that cause massive destruction of the epithelium, such as
What may the epithelial destruction cause? <BM25> Enteropathogenic viruses are believed to infect epithelial cells resulting in cell destruction, necrosis and intestinal perforation.
What is recommended that patients with chronic airway inflammatory disease? <BM25> IFV, usually result in severe acute exacerbations with non-classical symptoms of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Fortunately, annual vaccines are available to prevent IFV infections ; and it is recommended that patients with chronic airway inflammatory disease receive their annual influenza vaccination as the best means to prevent severe IFV induced exacerbation.
What is another mechanism that viral infections use to drive acute exacerbations? <BM25> Another mechanism that viral infections may use to drive acute exacerbations is the induction of vasodilation or tight junction opening factors which may increase the rate of infiltration. Infection with a multitude of respiratory viruses causes disruption of tight junctions with the resulting increased rate of viral infiltration. This also increases the chances of allergens coming into contact with airway immune cells. For example, IFV infection was found to induce oncostatin M which causes tight junction opening . Similarly, RV and RSV infections usually cause tight junction opening which may also increase the infiltration rate of eosinophils and thus worsening
What does infection of respiratory viruses cause? <BM25> Text: Introduction Gastroenteritis and respiratory tract infection outbreaks represent a significant burden of illness in nursing homes. Viruses cause the majority of these outbreaks, and noroviruses and influenza viruses are the most common pathogens .
What is an example of this? <BM25> example.
What are also associated with viral infections and pneumonia development <BM25> of the classical symptoms of chronic airway inflammatory diseases . In addition, the expression of vasodilating factors and fluid homeostatic factors such as angiopoietin-like 4 and bactericidal/permeabilityincreasing fold-containing family member A1 are also associated with viral infections and pneumonia development, which may worsen inflammation in the lower airway Akram et al., 2018) . These factors may serve as targets to prevent viral-induced exacerbations during the management of acute exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases.
What is another area of interest? <BM25> Nanopatterned surfaces with functional nanoparticles is another area of interest with the aim of well organized structures on the surface . Steric hindrance and the binding effectiveness can be adjusted. The steric accessibility is an important factor for formation of the antigenantibody complex at the surface.
What is usually linked with the development of chronic airway inflammatory diseases? <BM25> Another recent area of interest is the relationship between asthma and COPD exacerbations and their association with the airway microbiome. The development of chronic airway inflammatory diseases is usually linked to specific bacterial species in the microbiome which may thrive in the inflamed airway environment . In the event of a viral infection such as RV infection, the effect induced by the virus may destabilize the equilibrium of the microbiome present . In addition, viral infection may disrupt biofilm colonies in the upper airway microbiome to be release into the lower airway and worsening the inflammation . Moreover, a viral
What follows  in the event of a viral infection such as RV infection? <BM25> different serotype seems to be a very rare event if it exists at all. The appearance of limited mutations in the neutralizing antigens that do not change the viral serotype have been proposed as a factor that could be favoring RV reinfection, but this hypothesis remains unproven at present .
What does the viral infection alter? <BM25> there was neither CPE nor evidence of viral replication in the non-permissive macrophage cultures at 48 h after infection and later. Aging the non-permissive macrophages up to 4 weeks prior to infection did not alter their response to MHV-4.
What is  the destabilization is further compounded by? <BM25> transcript destabilization .
What does all this gradually lead to? <BM25> Gradually, this negative pressure exerts an undermining effect and deteriorates the pleasure of operating, as well as the relationship with others. A growing fatigue is developing, which can either precipitate an early retirement decision or even lead the surgeon to another career. Some even mentioned a "dark side" of the profession.
Why do these changes may  result in more severe and frequent acute exacerbations ? <BM25> an increased risk of experiencing an AECOPD would have more frequent acute exacerbations during one year of follow-up if they were deficient in MBL than if they were not.
How effective are microbiome based  trial therapies? <BM25> To counteract these effects, microbiome-based therapies are in their infancy but have shown efficacy in the treatments of irritable bowel syndrome by restoring the intestinal microbiome . Further research can be done similarly for the airway microbiome to be able to restore the microbiome following disruption by a viral infection.
What can viral infections cause? <BM25> not restricted to HIV-infection as many viral infections induce IFNa responses and cause transient lymphocytopenia in the infected hosts .
Which is the primary contact/infection site of most respiratory viruses? <BM25> Viral infections can cause the disruption of mucociliary function, an important component of the epithelial barrier. Ciliary proteins FIGURE 2 | Changes in the upper airway epithelium contributing to viral exacerbation in chronic airway inflammatory diseases. The upper airway epithelium is the primary contact/infection site of most respiratory viruses. Therefore, its infection by respiratory viruses may have far reaching consequences in augmenting and synergizing current and future acute exacerbations. The destruction of epithelial barrier, mucociliary function and cell death of the epithelial cells serves to increase contact between environmental triggers with the lower airway and resident immune cells. The opening
What does the destruction of epithelial barrier <BM25> epithelial barrier, but has also the capacity to penetrate through intact membranes .
What are viral infections are usually accompanied with? <BM25> Inflammation is minimal in certain infections of mesodermal elements in the CNS, such as the hemorrhagic encephalopathy produced by certain strains of influenza and rat viruses . Infections primarily of leptomeninges or ependyma are usually accompanied by inflammation; this is seen in the areas of cellular infection, but may also be present in the uninfected parenchyma of the CNS (R. T. .
What is the dysregulation of inflammation can be further compounded by? <BM25> of tight junction increasing the leakiness further augments the inflammation and exacerbations. In addition, viral infections are usually accompanied with oxidative stress which will further increase the local inflammation in the airway. The dysregulation of inflammation can be further compounded by modulation of miRNAs and epigenetic modification such as DNA methylation and histone modifications that promote dysregulation in inflammation. Finally, the change in the local airway environment and inflammation promotes growth of pathogenic bacteria that may replace the airway microbiome. Furthermore, the inflammatory environment may also disperse upper airway commensals into the lower airway, further causing inflammation and alteration of
What does  the change in the local airway environment and inflammation promote? <BM25> burst as a means of increasing the ROS in the infected region. The increased ROS and oxidative stress in the local environment may serve as a trigger to promote inflammation thereby aggravating the inflammation in the airway . A summary of potential exacerbation mechanisms and the associated viruses is shown in Figure 2 and Table 1 .
What does the the inflammatory environment dispersal of upper airway commensals into the lower airway cause? <BM25> of tight junction increasing the leakiness further augments the inflammation and exacerbations. In addition, viral infections are usually accompanied with oxidative stress which will further increase the local inflammation in the airway. The dysregulation of inflammation can be further compounded by modulation of miRNAs and epigenetic modification such as DNA methylation and histone modifications that promote dysregulation in inflammation.

Furthermore, the inflammatory environment may also disperse upper airway commensals into the lower airway, further causing inflammation and alteration of
Which are the most commonly  studied viruses in chronic airway inflammatory diseases? <BM25> As RV, RSV, and IFV were the most frequently studied viruses in chronic airway inflammatory diseases, most of the viruses listed are predominantly these viruses. However, the mechanisms stated here may also be applicable to other viruses but may not be listed as they were not implicated in the context of chronic airway inflammatory diseases exacerbation .
What do the infections such as RSV are shown to do? <BM25> severity of RSV infections.
What does mucus overproduction do? <BM25> diseases also include the capacity to raise the expression of MUC2 and MUC5AC , which contributes to mucus overproduction, a major feature of asthma.
What does the disruption of the ciliary movement during viral infection may cause? <BM25> 5 and multiciliate differentiation And DNA synthesis associated cell cycle protein . Furthermore, viral infections such as RSV was shown to directly destroy the cilia of the ciliated cells and almost all respiratory viruses infect the ciliated cells . In addition, mucus overproduction may also disrupt the equilibrium of the mucociliary function following viral infection, resulting in symptoms of acute exacerbation . Hence, the disruption of the ciliary movement during viral infection may cause more foreign material and allergen to enter the airway, aggravating the symptoms of acute exacerbation and making it more difficult to manage. The mechanism of the
What are MicroRNAs(miRNA)? <BM25> it. Aiming at this moving target will require out-of-the-box thinking and interdisciplinary collaboration.
What are  miRNAs found to be induced by? <BM25> regions of three host miRNAs, namely, miR-161, miR-27, and miR-42 . Both HSURs have been also found in Argonaute 2 complexes from HVS-transformed marmoset cells .
What  were linked to the exacerbation of the airway inflammation disease? <BM25> MicroRNAs are short non-coding RNAs involved in post-transcriptional modulation of biological processes, and implicated in a number of diseases . miRNAs are found to be induced by viral infections and may play a role in the modulation of antiviral responses and inflammation . In the case of chronic airway inflammatory diseases, circulating miRNA changes were found to be linked to exacerbation of the diseases . Therefore, it is likely that such miRNA changes originated from the infected epithelium and responding immune cells, which may serve to further dysregulate airway inflammation leading to exacerbations. Both IFV and RSV infections has been
Where might such miRNA changes have originated from? <BM25> Recently, a few researchers have studied the miRNA repertoire using domestic cats or cell culture originated from feline kidney cells as a basis to study CPV/Mink enteritis virus infection model .
What are both IFV and RSV infections shown to do? <BM25> As RV, RSV, and IFV were the most frequently studied viruses in chronic airway inflammatory diseases, most of the viruses listed are predominantly these viruses. However, the mechanisms stated here may also be applicable to other viruses but may not be listed as they were not implicated in the context of chronic airway inflammatory diseases exacerbation .
What are IFV infection shown to do? <BM25> in the TLR7-meditated response to IFV.
What happens in in asthmatic epithelium in IFV infection? <BM25> in the TLR7-meditated response to IFV.

What mechanisms <BM25> mechanisms.
What have  recent epigenetic studies indicated? <BM25> viral induced airway changes as a means of managing exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Other than miRNA modulation, other epigenetic modification such as DNA methylation may also play a role in exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Recent epigenetic studies have indicated the association of epigenetic modification and chronic airway inflammatory diseases, and that the nasal methylome was shown to be a sensitive marker for airway inflammatory changes . At the same time, it was also shown that viral infections such as RV and RSV alters DNA methylation and histone modifications in the airway epithelium which may alter inflammatory
What have these studies also shown? <BM25> recent studies have shown that PRC1 and PRC2 recruitment to chromatin, and associated histone modifying activities, can also be independent of each other .
What has Spalluto et.al. have shown? <BM25> was performed as described by Gratecos etal. .
What infections such as RV and RSV that weakly induce antiviral responses may result in? <BM25> responses, driving chronic airway inflammatory diseases and exacerbations . In addition, Spalluto et al. also showed that antiviral factors such as IFNγ epigenetically modifies the viral resistance of epithelial cells. Hence, this may indicate that infections such as RV and RSV that weakly induce antiviral responses may result in an altered inflammatory state contributing to further viral persistence and exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases .
What can viral infection result in? <BM25> AV-MAF before infection did not result in diminished viral growth compared with cells exposed to this lymphokine for 20 hr .
What sustains the inflammation  in the airway? <BM25> Finally, viral infection can result in enhanced production of reactive oxygen species , oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in the airway epithelium . The airway epithelium of patients with chronic airway inflammatory diseases are usually under a state of constant oxidative stress which sustains the inflammation in the airway . Viral infections of the respiratory epithelium by viruses such as IFV, RV, RSV and HSV may trigger the further production of ROS as an antiviral mechanism Aizawa et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018) . Moreover, infiltrating cells in response to the infection such as neutrophils will also trigger respiratory

Viral infections of the respiratory epithelium by viruses such as IFV, RV, RSV and HSV may trigger the further production of ROS as an antiviral mechanism Aizawa et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018) . Moreover, infiltrating cells in response to the infection such as neutrophils will also trigger respiratory
What can happen  in response to the infection such as neutrophils? <BM25> For the case of asynchronous updating method, the infection and recovery cannot happen simultaneously, Eq. thus becomes
In addition to worsening disease symptoms <BM25> worsening or recurrent symptoms.
What may studies in natural exacerbations and in viral-challenge models using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) or single cell RNA-seq on a range of time-points  provide? <BM25> studies in natural exacerbations and in viral-challenge models using RNA-sequencing or single cell RNA-seq on a range of time-points may provide important information regarding viral pathogenesis and changes induced within the airway of chronic airway inflammatory disease patients to identify novel targets and pathway for improved management of the disease. Subsequent analysis of functions may use epithelial cell models such as the air-liquid interface, in vitro airway epithelial model that has been adapted to studying viral infection and the changes it induced in the airway . Animal-based diseased models have also been developed to identify systemic mechanisms of acute exacerbation
What analysis functions may be useful? <BM25> expression of clock genes in peripheral tissues, indicating that the analysis of clock gene expression profiles in peripheral tissues may provide useful clues for the elucidation of their individual circadian functions .
For what  purpose animal based models aare developed for? <BM25> Animal models are also classified based on the type of SCI. The following sections will provide an overview on the available SCI models that are developed based on injury mechanisms, their specifications and relevance to human SCI .
What can be used unravel the immune profile of a viral infection in healthy and diseased condition? <BM25> . Furthermore, the humanized mouse model that possess human immune cells may also serves to unravel the immune profile of a viral infection in healthy and diseased condition . For milder viruses, controlled in vivo human infections can be performed for the best mode of verification of the associations of the virus with the proposed mechanism of viral induced acute exacerbations . With the advent of suitable diseased models, the verification of the mechanisms will then provide the necessary continuation of improving the management of viral induced acute exacerbations.

With the advent of suitable diseased models, the verification of the mechanisms will then provide the necessary continuation of improving the management of viral induced acute exacerbations.
Why may the  mechanisms of exacerbation vary considerably? <BM25> are due to the effect of enhanced acute airway inflammation impacting upon and worsening the symptoms of the existing disease . These acute exacerbations are the main cause of morbidity and sometimes mortality in patients, as well as resulting in major economic burdens worldwide. However, due to the complex interactions between the host and the exacerbation agents, the mechanisms of exacerbation may vary considerably in different individuals under various triggers. Acute exacerbations are usually due to the presence of environmental factors such as allergens, pollutants, smoke, cold or dry air and pathogenic microbes in the airway . These agents elicit
What clinical condition is caused by Hantaan virus? <BM25> be caused by the inhibition of cell to cell spread of virus infection, since the F protein mediated the cell to cell fusion but not relate to the virus attachment to cell. We have reported that Hantaan virus has cell fusion activity underthe low pH condition . Therefore, to examine the neutralization mechanism related to the newly recognized antigenic site, attachment blocking activity as well as fusion inhibition activity of clones 8El0 and 1 C6 will be required.
What is the structure of Hantaan virus? <BM25> virus, Hantaan virus, coronavirus, reovirus, cytomegalovirus and Mycoplasma pulmonis.

How is Interferon used in practice? <BM25> who had contact with contaminated blood did not develop disease . South African patients who were treated with high doses of human leukocyte interferon either prophylactically or therapeutically developed severe side-effects; the practice was stopped .
What genotypes are associated with the severity of HFRS? <BM25> Frequencies of seven hla-a*0201 highaffinity hTnV gP epitope-specific cD8 + T cells Were associated with the severity of hFrs Disease
Which IFITM proteins have been shown to possess antiviral activity? <BM25> the cell membrane and significantly diminishes the antiviral activity. Moreover, the cysteines in IFITM2, Cys70, Cys71, and Cys104 are also palmitoylated in the same manner, which affects the intracellular localization . A resent study has revealed that murine IFITM1 has four cysteine residues for the S-palmitoylation, which is required for the antiviral activity and the protein stability . The other IFITM family members also possess these cysteines , and thus the role of the Spalmitoylation on the cysteines should be significant for the functions of IFITM proteins.
What is the hypothesized mechanism by which IFITMs work? <BM25> metalloprotease, ZMPSTE24, previously implicated in processing nuclear lamins, is an essential cofactor for IFITMs independent of its catalytic activity . As yet, the mechanism for its role is not known.
What genotype causes truncation of the IFITM3 protein? <BM25> Since NSs can self-associate and form filamentous inclusion bodies in infected cells , we hypothesized that co-expression of nonfunctional NSs with the C-terminal self-association domain in cells infected with RVFV allows incorporation of such nonfunctional NSs into the NSs filament, and attenuates a part of NSs functions. However, our results were not as expected; 1) most of truncated NSs localized at cytoplasm, 2) all of truncated NSs did Our results suggest truncation of NSs causes mis-folding and/or mis-localization of protein, which might abolish the ability to interact with authentic MP-12 NSs through the C-terminus selfassociation domain. Unexpectedly, only the co-expression

What is the estimated number of people in Italy infected with coronavirus by March 28th? <BM25> Down syndrome is the most common chromosomal abnormality among live-born infants. The number of people with DS living in the United States has grown from 49,923 in 1950 to 206,366 in 2010 . There are no population-based registries in Italy, but the prevalence of people with DS living in Italy is estimated at approximately 30,000. More than half of them are over 25, and 3000 are over 45 years old .
In 2009 what was the reported H1N1 vaccination rate in China? <BM25> The colectomy rate in our study was found to be 7.7%, while the colectomy rate in hospitalized SUC patients reported by the West China Hospital is 17.9%, both are lower than the 20%-40% reported in United Kingdom .

On June 11, 2009 , the World Health Organization raised the pandemic level to 6, the highest level for pandemic alert .
What does it mean for a pandemic to have a WHO alert level of 6? <BM25> advanced to a "pandemic alert period."
What was the estimated economic impact in the U.S. from the 2009 SARS pandemic? <BM25> Estimating the economic impact of pandemic disease is usually very difficult. The outbreak of SARS in 2003 showed that even a disease with relatively small health impact can have a major economic effect. It is believed that 8.000 people have been exposed to the SARS and, 800 people have died . The Asian development Bank estimated the economic impact of SARS near US$18 billion in East Asia. The health impact and economic impact can be inversely proportional for pandemic diseases. In this study, we estimate the economic impact of the pandemic influenza according to different scenarios and different attack rates.
How is 2019-nCOV transmitted? <BM25> disease is transmitted directly from human to human.
What are ways in  which 2019-nCOV is transmitted? <BM25> Viruses are very small microorganisms, ranging in size from 15 to 400 nm . Viruses cause a wide range of diseases in plants, animals and humans. These infections do not occur at random: each group of viruses has its own typical host range and cell preference . Viruses can be transmitted in different ways, for example by droplets generated when an infected person coughs, by contamination with stool samples from a person infected with an intestinal virus, by sexual intercourse, by contact with blood from infected persons with bloodborne viruses, by contact with infected animals with zoonotic viruses, or by

When was COVID  surveillance implemented in European region? <BM25> Text: In the WHO European Region, COVID-19 surveillance was implemented 27 January 2020. We detail the first European cases. As at 21 February, nine European countries reported 47 cases. Among 38 cases studied, 21 were linked to two clusters in Germany and France, 14 were infected in China. Median case age was 42 years; 25 were male. Late detection of the clusters' index cases delayed isolation of further local cases. As at 5 March, there were 4,250 cases.
As of 21 February <BM25> February 11, 2020
Where were the cases that were studied? <BM25> might benefit from initial over-triage, so as not to miss high-risk cases. Finally, the purpose of the screen-to compel further assessment and treatment-has not been adequately studied.
What was the median case age? <BM25> of cases were men and the median age was 61 years . Forty-four died resulting in a case fatality proportion of 33% .

Group nine was the largest and comprised 591 clusters that were mostly annotated and expressed predominantly in muscle tissue. Group seven consisted of 533 clusters that were also mostly annotated and expressed predominantly in hepatopancreatic tissue. Except for male gonad, most clusters expressed in adult tissue types were also expressed in the early life-history stages.

When did the Chinese authorities share the sequence of a novel coronavirus ? <BM25> A cluster of pneumonia of unknown origin was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 . On 12 January 2020, Chinese authorities shared the sequence of a novel coronavirus termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 isolated from some clustered cases . Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been named coronavirus disease 2019 . As at 21 February 2020, the virus had spread rapidly mostly within China but also to 28 other countries, including in the World Health Organization European Region .
What is the name of the disease caused buy SARS-COV-2? <BM25> The change in price was related to the change in demand for the good, caused by a change in the conditions of the market in which the good was situated. For instance, the commodity became more popular, people become more frightened to buy the goods, or there were more substitutes available in the market.
What country does this study exclude? <BM25> of indicators reported and country where the study was done are reported in Table 1 .
What does the study include? <BM25> we request permission from REBs to include data collected during study participation.

When was the first reported death in France? <BM25> The first three cases detected were reported in France on 24 January 2020 and had onset of symptoms on 17, 19 and 23 January respectively . The first death was reported on 15 February in France. As at 21 February, nine countries had reported cases : Belgium , Finland , France , Germany , Italy , Russia , Spain , Sweden and the UK .
What is the presumed incubation period? <BM25> Blumberg and co-workers observed the presence of Au antigen in the serum of patients with hepatitis of presumed viral origin ; and Prince , and subsequently other workers , demonstrated the appearance of this antigen late in the incubation period of SH, as distinct from IH, its transient presence in most cases, and its apparently tolerated persistence in some.
What were the places of infection? <BM25> ordered public places were shut.27 18/3/2020
What places were linked to these? <BM25> emerging and reemerging diseases such as chikungunya and Zika, have also been linked to climate change influences, and have been proposed as partially responsible for autochnous transmission in places not traditionally endemic for such diseases .
How many cases were hospitalised? <BM25> Included cases were either fatal or hospitalised cases of confirmed or probable influenza Apdm09 confirmed by PCR or culture. Probable cases included those with positive influenza A serology during 2009-2010, but not testing of subtype.
Why were they hospitalised? <BM25> 2 days to be hospitalised.
What was time from onset to hospitalisation? <BM25> the literature coincided with our estimate . In addition, our estimates of the overall CFR for Kikwit and Boende coincided with other estimates reported in the literature and 74% , respectively). The remaining outbreak estimates have not been studied by other authors and are reported here for the first time. Overall, CFRs and delays between symptom onset and hospitalisation, symptom onset and death, and hospitalisation and death reported in our study do not differ substantially with those reported for the current outbreak . The data presented were originally collected for the containment of the outbreaks rather than for providing the
What was the duration of hospitalisation? <BM25> The case records of 90 dyspnoeic cats were retrospectively reviewed and separated into different groups depending on aetiology . Duration of clinical signs, presentation, hospitalisation length and survival were analysed.
Why was this? <BM25> it. Aiming at this moving target will require out-of-the-box thinking and interdisciplinary collaboration.

How many cases were asymptomatic? <BM25> for infected individuals in the late incubation period, for asymptomatic cases.
What were the asymptomatic cases tested as? <BM25> 51 , and many cases reported exposure to poultry and poultry products purchased from urban live bird markets 50 . It is likely that there are many undetected H9N2 cases in Bangladesh in humans exposed to infected poultry and live bird markets, but were never tested for influenza due to lack of severe illness or asymptomatic infections 52, 53 .
For how many cases Fever reported as the sole symptom? <BM25> Symptoms at the point of diagnosis were reported for 31 cases. Two cases were asymptomatic and remained so until tested negative. The asymptomatic cases were tested as part of screening following repatriation and during contact tracing respectively. Of the remaining 29, 20 reported fever, 14 reported cough and eight reported weakness. Additional symptoms reported included headaches , sore throat , rhinorrhoea , shortness of breath , myalgia , diarrhoea and nausea . Fever was reported as the sole symptom for nine cases. In 16 of 29 symptomatic cases, the symptoms at diagnosis were consistent with the case definition for acute
In how many cases the symptoms at diagnosis were consistent with the case definition for acute respiratory infection? <BM25> The clinical presentation observed in the cases in Europe is that of an acute respiratory infection. However, of the 31 cases with information on symptoms, 20 cases presented with fever and nine cases presented only with fever and no other symptoms. These findings, which are consistent with other published case series, have prompted ECDC to include fever among several clinical signs or symptoms indicative for the suspected case definition.
How many cases had data on preexisting conditions? <BM25> group with preexisting renal failure, but not in the group with normal renal baseline conditions.
How many cases had no pre-existing conditions? <BM25> victims in order to control infection. Many other stress conditions can lead to ARDS; more than 150,000 cases per year were reported in the United States alone with over 50 percent mortality'.

What was the clinical evolution of the hospitalised cases? <BM25> All hospitalised cases had a benign clinical evolution except four, two reported in Italy and two reported in France, all of whom developed viral pneumonia. All three cases who were aged 65 years or over were admitted to intensive care and required respiratory support and one French case died. The case who died was hospitalised for 21 days and required intensive care and mechanical ventilation for 19 days. The duration of hospitalisation was reported for 16 cases with a median of 13 days . As at 21 February 2020, four cases were still hospitalised.

How will  this approach used? <BM25> approach, as well as the safety of the drugs used for this purpose.
Why is additional research needed? <BM25> cluster in response to exposure to a natural disaster, additional research is needed.
What growing dysjunction has been witnessed? <BM25> published since 1990. 2017 witnessed the publication of The Handbook of Salutogenesis, containing contributions from salutogenic scholars from around the world. These are positive developments, which have contributed greatly to the growing scholarship on salutogenesis and understanding the mysterious origins of health. However, while the salutogenic model of health is starting to impact health promotion at the level of theory and research, the benefits of Antonovsky's formulation for population health promotion practices and healthcare restructuring are, at present, unrealized with the pathogenic paradigm still dominant in considerations of health, healing, and healthcare .

What ways to  solve the issues are outlined? <BM25> The following other kinds of products are important in different ways, as they raise issues which are different from those encountered with chemicals and pharmaceuticals.
How do these exact processes ultimately restrict viral infectivity? <BM25> Opening this CTI Special Feature, I outline ways these issues may be solved by creatively leveraging the so-called 'strengths' of viruses. Viral RNA polymerisation and reverse transcription enable resistance to treatment by conferring extraordinary genetic diversity. However, these exact processes ultimately restrict viral infectivity by strongly limiting virus genome sizes and their incorporation of new information. I coin this evolutionary dilemma the 'information economy paradox'. Many viruses attempt to resolve this by manipulating multifunctional or multitasking host cell proteins , thereby maximising host subversion and viral infectivity at minimal informational cost. 4 I argue this exposes an 'Achilles Heel' that

How do many viruses resolve this ? <BM25> the user to resolve.
How may this "Achilles Heel" be safely targeted? <BM25> our study , similar to those recently reported by Oderich et al 17 and Dossabhoy et al 18 but much higher than the 4.5% reported in the meta-analysis by Georgiadis et al. 19 Reinterventions seem more and more to appear in the literature as the Achilles heel of the physician-modified technique. This may be explained by high rates of endoleaks, requiring close and patient-specific follow-up.
Why  may MMHP-targeting therapies exhibit both robust and broadspectrum antiviral efficacy? <BM25> protonophore independent of protein targets with broadspectrum antiviral efficacy enforces the concept of host targeting for antiviral therapies. It may spur the development of novel directed protonophores tuned to particular cellular compartments.

What domembers of the Roquin and Regnase families do? <BM25> Upon infection, pathogens stimulate expression of numerous host inflammatory factors that support recruitment and activation of immune cells. On the flip side, this same process also causes immunopathology when prolonged or deregulated. 5 In their contribution to this Special Feature, Yoshinaga and Takeuchi review endogenous RNA-binding proteins that post-transcriptionally control expression of crucial inflammatory factors in various tissues and their potential therapeutic applications. 6 These RBPs include tristetraprolin and AUF1, which promote degradation of AU-rich element -containing mRNA; members of the Roquin and Regnase families, which respectively promote or effect degradation of mRNAs harbouring stem-loop structures; and the increasingly apparent

Where do these activities take place? <BM25> Settings in which public health activities and interventions take place, institutional and social environments, partnerships, and locations .
What happens to these activities during infection? <BM25> these properties only depend on what happens in the intervals after the interval of infection. We can compute these properties for the herd infected at t = 0.
In this way <BM25> be distinguished in this way.
What can be  done with the  'brake' on the immune system? <BM25> as a brake on the metabolic system. Efforts to identify the proteomic, lipidomic, and functional fingerprints of HDL subspecies are of critical importance and may open paths to novel pharmacological targets.
What does the author anticipate that continued efforts will lead to? <BM25> role of the RNA methylation machinery in controlling inflammatory mRNA stability. These activities take place in various subcellular compartments and are differentially regulated during infection. In this way, mRNA-destabilising RBPs constitute a 'brake' on the immune system, which may ultimately be toggled therapeutically. I anticipate continued efforts in this area will lead to new methods of regaining control over inflammation in autoimmunity, selectively enhancing immunity in immunotherapy, and modulating RNA synthesis and virus replication during infection.
What is another mRNA under post-transcriptional regulation by Regnase-1 and Roquin? <BM25> Another mRNA under post-transcriptional regulation by Regnase-1 and Roquin is Furin, which encodes a conserved proprotein convertase crucial in human health and disease. Furin, along with other PCSK family members, is widely implicated in immune regulation, cancer and the entry, maturation or release of a broad array of evolutionarily diverse viruses including human papillomavirus , influenza , Ebola , dengue and human immunodeficiency virus . Here, Braun and Sauter review the roles of furin in these processes, as well as the history and future of furin-targeting therapeutics. 7 They also discuss their recent work revealing how two IFN-cinducible factors exhibit

How was the epidemic curve modelled? <BM25> Abstract: Background: In December 2019, an outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China and has swiftly spread to other parts of China and a number of foreign countries. The 2019-nCoV cases might have been under-reported roughly from 1 to 15 January 2020, and thus we estimated the number of unreported cases and the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV. Methods: We modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases, in mainland China from 1 December 2019 to 24 January 2020 through the exponential growth. The number of unreported cases was determined by the maximum likelihood

What would be the benefit of the identity of the S2 unit? <BM25> I T represents a identity matrix, W N is a cross-sectional spatial weighting matrix, with its diagonal elements set to zero, implying that no unit can be a neighbour to itself.
How do the S1 subunits compare with that of SARS-likeCOV and human SARS-COV? <BM25> described in 2004 and human in 2009 . In 2007, it was reported that mutations in any of the three subunits of human RNase H2 cause Aicardi-Gouti eres syndrome .
Where are the amino acid differences? <BM25> that nucleotide differences ranged from 0.1% to 11.9%, and amino acid differences ranged from 0.1% to 7.2% .
What is responsible for the interaction with  host receptor? <BM25> higher than at hH 2 R-Gsα S, but lower than at gpH 2 R-Gsα S ! Tyr-17/Asp-271 interaction not solely responsible for h/gp species differences • Possibly stabilization of ligand-specific receptor conformations
what will the investigation of external subdomain reveal? <BM25> subunit of 2019-nCoV shares around 70% identity to that of the two bat SARS-like CoVs and human SARS-CoV ), the core domain of RBD are highly conserved ). Most of the amino acid differences of RBD are located in the external subdomain, which is responsible for the direct interaction with the host receptor. Further investigation of this soluble variable external subdomain region will reveal its receptor usage, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis. Unlike 2019-nCoV and human SARS-CoV, most known bat SARSr-CoVs have two stretches of deletions in the spike receptor binding domain when compared with that of human SARS-CoV. But some
How do most bat SARSr-COV differ from 2019-nCOV and  human SARS-COV? <BM25> https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0180716.t005 Table 5 ). The percentage of disease systems having bats and primates within the reservoir increased with epidemic potential . However, the distribution of bat reservoirs amongst the zones was not significantly different , while the distribution of primate reservoirs did significantly differ with epidemic potential .
Which strains  do  not have such deletions? <BM25> deletions in aa149-157
What is the consequence of  lack of deletions in Yunnan strains? <BM25> in terms of identity . When compared with two vaccine strains, SH and LG , all nucleotide homology levels of the Yunnan strains were 94.7-98% and 95.1-96.7%, respectively.
Being closest to 2019-nCoV <BM25> closest to the known transmission rate.
What would lessen the likelihood of jumping the barrier? <BM25> Yunnan strains such as the WIV1 had no such deletions and can use human ACE2 as a cellular entry receptor. It is interesting to note that the two bat SARS-related coronavirus ZXC21 and ZC45, being closest to 2019-nCoV, can infect suckling rats and cause inflammation in the brain tissue, and pathological changes in lung & intestine. However, these two viruses could not be isolated in Vero E6 cells and were not investigated further. The two retained deletion sites in the Spike genes of ZXC21 and ZC45 may lessen their likelihood of jumping species barriers imposed by receptor specificity.
What do the results indicate? <BM25> These results indicate that the full-length of Smp76 may be required for its activity against HCV and DENV.

Where can published genomic sequences be found for the 2019-nCoV virus? <BM25> For human parainfluenza virus 1 , the 1,992 bases of the HN gene were obtained by RT-nested PCR following the previously published method 28 . The obtained genomic RNA sequences and RT-PCR-positive amplicons were further analysed with related sequences in GenBank using MAFFT 29 and MEGA version 6 30 .
What genes have been targeted for the diagnostic RT-PCR tests in 2019-nCoV? <BM25> underlining a need for better diagnostic tests, targeted prevention, and early treatment strategies.
How does being a smoker impact COVID-19 patient outcomes? <BM25> We assessed the extent to which studies reported a measurable impact on health, reproductive, psychological, and behavioral outcomes for the patient or the patient's family, including:
Are smokers more likely to contract influenza? <BM25> disease prognosis, as extensive evidence has highlighted the negative impact of tobacco use on lung health and its causal association with a plethora of respiratory diseases. Smoking is also detrimental to the immune system and its responsiveness to infections, making smokers more vulnerable to infectious diseases. Previous studies have shown that smokers are twice more likely than non-smokers to contract influenza and have more severe symptoms, while smokers were also noted to have higher mortality in the previous MERS-CoV outbreak. Given the gap in the evidence, we conducted a systematic review of studies on COVID-19 that included information on patients’
Why might we underestimate the spread of COVID19? <BM25> as only ten common and newly identified viruses were included in our study, which might underestimate positive rate or coinfection rate. It was notable that the correlation between co-infection rate and positive rate was not observed.
Where was the first imported case of COVID19 in the United States? <BM25> The first Australian case of influenza Apdm09 was identified on 8 May 2009. Two weeks later, Victoria's first case was identifieda nine-year-old boy who had recently returned from the United States . In the ensuing 12-day period, 'contain' pandemic response measures including case isolation, voluntary home quarantine and school closure were implemented, in an effort to prevent wider community spread of the imported virus.
When was the first case of COVID19 confirmed in the USA? <BM25> Until June 5th, the rate of imported cases has been stable in Germany. The first identified cases in Germany were confirmed on April 29 th , and until June 5 th a total number of 49 confirmed cases had been reported ). Of these 41 had a known travel history to Mexico, the United Kingdom or the USA; of the remaining 8 cases 7 had been contacts to one of the imported cases and for one case the source case was unknown but might have been related to contacts with travellers . The average number of imported cases during this
When was the second COVID19 case reported in the US? <BM25> Let us assume a more realistic approximation, in which triples are uncorrelated, but we keep the correlation of the pairs. In this case, there are only three independent probabilities of pairs: P i,j , P i,j , and P i,j . Thus, the differential equations of first and second moments of the probabilities distribution are
Where was the second reported case of COVID in the United States? <BM25> United States late in 1889 or early in 1890. The second
When was the first local transmission of COVID reported in the United States? <BM25> Here we describe the epidemiology of the first cases of COVID-19 in this region, excluding cases reported in the United Kingdom , as at 21 February 2020. The study includes a comparison between cases detected among travellers from China and cases whose infection was acquired due to subsequent local transmission.
When did the WHO declare COVID to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern? <BM25> or medication for treatment, the global Zika outbreaks have prompted the World Health Organization to declare ZIKV as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in February 2016 .
When did the United States declare COVID19 a public health emergency? <BM25> or medication for treatment, the global Zika outbreaks have prompted the World Health Organization to declare ZIKV as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in February 2016 .
What are the most common symptoms of COVID19? <BM25> the failure of bud break and the wilting of young sprouts that are common symptoms in early spring.
What symptoms might people experience with COVID19? <BM25> According to the epidemiological characteristics of shigellosis and our previous study , we set k and γ' as 0.3125 and 0.0286, respectively. The proportions of asymptomatic individuals were reported to range from 0.0037 to 0.2700 . We set p = 0.1 in the SEIAR model. The incubation of shigellosis was reported to range from 1 to 3 days . Therefore, we set ω as 0.3333 to 1.000. The symptoms generally last for 1 week, but certain people may experience symptoms for several weeks . We assumed the course of the disease was up to 3 weeks. Therefore, we set γ
Who is at greater risk of dying from COVID19? <BM25> There were 14 deaths caused by confirmed IMD , of which 8 were in children < 16 years old. The overall case fatality rate was 12.6% . In children < 16 years of age, the highest age-specific CFR was in 1-5-year-olds , 6-10-year-olds and 11-15-year-olds , whilst in adults, the highest risk of dying was in 46-64-year-olds and in ≥ 65-year-olds .
How long is the incubation time for COVID19? <BM25> Hence, a pre-defined 24-hour activity sequence can be easily assigned to each synthetic individual, according to their profession and social duties. The time step for the activity sequence was chosen to be 30 minutes. Finer time steps can also be used, but are not necessary as the incubation period is relatively long.
How does COVID19 get spread? <BM25> These values form the entries in a 2 Â 2 next-generation matrix. The disease can spread if the leading eigenvalue of this matrix is larger than one. By pulling the repeated factor out of the matrix, we get the condition
Is it possible to get infected with COVID and another virus? <BM25> . Assuming that every case i > 2 was infected by another case in the set of observed cases, we get:
How many people  are estimated to need humanitarian assistance in 2020? <BM25> Text: Over 168 million people across 50 countries are estimated to need humanitarian assistance in 2020 . Response to epidemics in complex humanitarian crisessuch as the recent cholera epidemic in Yemen and the Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congois a global health challenge of increasing scale . The thousands of Yemeni and Congolese who have died in these years-long epidemics demonstrate the difficulty of combatting even well-known pathogens in humanitarian settings. The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 may represent a still greater threat to those in complex humanitarian crises, which lack the infrastructure, support, and health systems
For whom does the  SARS-COV-2 pose a great threat? <BM25> the infection did not pose an immediate threat to most individuals.
What can undermine interventions? <BM25> to mount a comprehensive response. Poor governance, public distrust, and political violence may further undermine interventions in these settings.
Who are expected to be particularly susceptible? <BM25> whose developing nervous system is particularly susceptible to this bystander effect .
Why populations may be particularly susceptible? <BM25> and native frogs are particularly susceptible to the cane toad toxin and many populations have been severely impacted by the arrival of cane toads .
What is the impact of disease outbreaks? <BM25> concern about the likelihood and potential impact of future FMD disease outbreaks, both in the UK and the USA. Using an AM approach could significantly reduce the burden of such an outbreak.
What represents a barrier to testing? <BM25> experimental results, strongly suggests that the G17E substitution found in viruses of the SIVmac lineage represents adaptation to overcome the interspecies genetic barrier imposed by rhA3G LR alleles.
Where are difficulties are exacerbated during humanitarian crises? <BM25> rights to dignity and to fully participate in decisions related to assistance in humanitarian crises. Widespread introduction of alcohol-based hand rubs is also possible in many resource-limited settings, with published protocols for local production .
What can prevent contact tracing? <BM25> and favour a decision against contact tracing.
What is an example of intractable structural challenge? <BM25> It is desirable to determine the dynamics of the number of susceptibles and infecteds and to develop equations in terms of those quantities. This, however, turns out to be intractable due to heterogeneity in the number of contacts. The problem can be resolved by developing equations in terms of dynamic variables representing network-based quantities, for example, the number of connections to susceptible or infectious nodes at a time t. The network-and node-based quantities are defined in the next section.
What should be the priority of the national and international bodies trying to prevent the pandemic? <BM25> in complex humanitarian crises. Frequent displacement and limited contact information may prevent effective contact tracing. Finally, intractable structural challenges such as overcrowding limit the implementation of both quarantine of those exposed and isolation of those who are ill. Given these increased vulnerabilities, humanitarian crises should be viewed as a priority for national and international bodies that seek to combat this unfolding pandemic. Resources must be identified to protect healthcare workers, develop and deploy rapid testing, improve surveillance, and enact quarantine and isolation of contacts and cases.
What  resources need to be identified? <BM25> all three of these identified common influences. Two key issues that need to be addressed when designing integrative interventions are the level of the intervention and the degree of "match" between job conditions, stress, and personal resources.
What is an effective public health hygiene? <BM25> Keywords public health ethics · social medicine · social hygiene · medical ethics · bioethics · health ethics
What has been demonstrated to  be  effective for prevention? <BM25> hope of effective prevention.
What has increased hand washing? <BM25> . In this context, Understanding has an independent contribution to hand washing practice only.
What is hand washing to protect one's own health  consistent with? <BM25> and therefore lower the general public's incentive to protect themselves against infectious diseases through vaccines, hand washing or other protective measures.
What is possible in many resource -limited  settings? <BM25> these vaccines inaccessible to most of the individuals in low resource settings, who demonstrate the greatest need for vaccination .
What is the foremost authority on minimum standards for humanitarian assistance? <BM25> The Sphere Handbook, a collection of rights-based guidelines for humanitarian response, is the foremost authority on minimum standards for humanitarian assistance . However, despite the indisputable evidence for the efficacy of hand hygiene for reducing both bacterial and viral pathogen transmission, humanitarian WASH standards are based on evidence pertaining to the prevention of illnesses transmitted by the faecal-oral route, with the focus on hand hygiene proximate to latrines . And yet, latrines in crisis settings are often shared and distant from residential shelters, conferring a high risk of gender-based violence . Gender-based violence around latrines is an important deterrent for
For what  there is evidence for  the efficacy of hand washing? <BM25> Soap is more effective at removing pathogens than washing with water alone . According to a meta-analysis of more than 30 hand hygiene studies conducted between 1960 and 2007, handwashing contributed to reducing digestive and respiratory system diseases by 31% , 19% to 42%) and 21% , respectively. The most efficacious intervention was handwashing with soap, with no difference in efficacy between antimicrobial and nonantimicrobial soap .
What are humanitarian WASH standards  based on? <BM25> The Sphere Handbook, a collection of rights-based guidelines for humanitarian response, is the foremost authority on minimum standards for humanitarian assistance . However, despite the indisputable evidence for the efficacy of hand hygiene for reducing both bacterial and viral pathogen transmission, humanitarian WASH standards are based on evidence pertaining to the prevention of illnesses transmitted by the faecal-oral route, with the focus on hand hygiene proximate to latrines . And yet, latrines in crisis settings are often shared and distant from residential shelters, conferring a high risk of gender-based violence . Gender-based violence around latrines is an important deterrent for
What confers a high risk of  gender  based violence? <BM25> Some studies show, that female staff is at higher risk of boundary violations and sexual harassment at in the workplace . We had very limited possibility to control and specify the correlation between violence against staff and gender in this small sample . It will be necessary to prove the effect of gender in studies with greater samples that take into account the effect of gender on boundary violations and hair cortisol concentration, even if we could not observe such an effect in our study.

What  will maximize the effectiveness of interventions? <BM25> Second, managers could inadvertently channel resources to purposes other than project objectives because of miscommunication, lack of competence, or lack of capacity . For example, those managing the project may not have the necessary technical or administrative skills to meet key objectives. Thus, the risk that managers inadvertently channel resources to purposes other than project objectives due to lack of competence needs to be assessed. Third, managers could lack credible information and evidence to maximize the cost-effectiveness of investments. The basis of cost-effectiveness is that interventions should not only have established effectiveness in reducing disease burden but also represent an
What will happen without the adaptation of existing standards? <BM25> Through provision of new HT solutions, adaptation of existing, or a combination to address several issues.
What is essential when pandemics threaten vulnerable populations? <BM25> Evidence-based guidelines alone in complex humanitarian crises may not suffice during the emergence of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Without the adaptation of existing standards, mitigation plans will fall short of health and human rights obligations in outbreak response. Crisis-affected community engagement is integral in pandemic planning, in order to maximize the real-world effectiveness of efficacious interventions. Transparent and credible information-sharing mechanisms are increasingly essential when pandemics threaten vulnerable populations . Diplomacy bridging long-standing mistrust of public health and biomedical interventions and facilitating engagement with contentious actors is a necessary component of effective health governance in complex crisis settings . Interventions
What is a necessary component of effective health  governance? <BM25> The goal of global governance of zoonoses lies in creating an effective regime of regulation. Below I will examine the notion of global regulatory regimes. Here, I seek to determine where in our understandings of public health as a regime of national regulation we find the necessary properties to be effective. The core argument is that a global governance regime of zoonoses regulation would need to be modeled on these characteristics.
Approximately how many people died during the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic? <BM25> An inter-seasonal or universal influenza vaccine is desperately needed; it will save many lives, whether in those unexpected years when the recommended composition is not matched, or when a pandemic occurs, as it did in 2009. The significance of the 1918 pandemic makes it very clear; up to 100 million people died. A universal vaccine is one that can be prepared for the unexpected, a virus that occurs due to the reassortment of viral genes from different host species.
What social and economic factors  contributed to the large fatality rate in the 1918 influenza pandemic? <BM25> mixed messages about the severity of the 2009 influenza H1N1 pandemic and about the actual need for isolation and social distancing would probably have contributed to a low acceptance rate.
What problems were faced by medical staff during the 1918 epidemic? <BM25> in the United States, France, India, Japan and Poland, 21, 22, 88, 91, 103 a fact that was not appreciated by any of the investigators who faced problems with VSEL sorting.
What helpful drugs are available now to control the disease or to provide palliative care for influenza patients? <BM25> The care of patients with progressive disease should include a discussion of goals of care, potentially limiting aggressive therapy, and referral to palliative care when appropriate for the management of symptoms and potentially improve quality of life.
How has the mortality rate due to influenza declined in USA over past decades? <BM25> America, the influenza classed mortality rate declined from 10.2/100,000 in the 1940s to 0.56/100,000 in the 1990s; and the classed mortality rates of 1957-1958 and 1968-1969 influenza pandemics were not remarkably different from the non-pandemic seasons .
Is there an Influenza vaccine? <BM25> combination vaccine , measles , and influenza vaccine .
for the 2009 influenza pandemic <BM25> pandemic influenza.
What  factors would contribute now to the faster rates of influenza infections? <BM25> In this study, we demonstrated that the administration of LFK improved survival rates and suppressed the infiltration of leukocytes into the lung after viral infection. Several factors could contribute to the effect of LFK against influenza virus infection. These include the suppression of leukocyte infiltration into the lungs by both the downregulation of CXCL4 expression and the modulation of pulmonary endothelial-epithelial permeability via the increase of type II pneumocytes and the repression of MMPs expression. Our findings support the notion that suppression of the breakdown of the alveolar-capillary barrier and the subsequent leukocyte influx into the lung would improve the
What factors would be responsible in future for the prevention of an Influenza pandemic? <BM25> Pandemic influenza in 2009 had a far greater impact on Aboriginal people and pregnant women compared both with the overall population in 2009 and with seasonal influenza in other years. Future pandemic planning should place a priority on prevention of serious illness in these groups.
What was the detected fatality rate of H7N9 Avian flu? <BM25> real case fatality rate should be much lower than the detected 32.14% .
Why would real  case fatality rate for the H7N9 be lower than detected rate? <BM25> real case fatality rate should be much lower than the detected 32.14% .
What is the structure of the Ebolavirus? <BM25> of specimens for evidence of active and past ebolavirus infection.
When was the West African Ebolavirus outbreak? <BM25> Ebola virus is a member of the genus Ebolavirus within the Filoviridae family of highly pathogenic viruses. These viruses cause a severe hemorrhagic fever syndrome in humans and non-human primates . EBOV infection frequently is associated with high mortality rates and is responsible for the devastating 2014 West African EBOV outbreak . This outbreak has generated a renewed emphasis on the development and approval of safe, effective prophylactics and therapeutics against the virus.
What animals are considered to be maintenance hosts to the Ebolavirus? <BM25> Potential maintenance mechanisms of ebolaviruses in wildlife, according to current knowledge. Circles indicate a maintenance function play by the host; arrows represent infectious transmission pathways between hosts. Humans, non-human primates, and duikers are examples of known non-maintenance hosts, exposed occasionally to ebolavirus directly or indirectly through the main maintenance host. Main maintenance hypothesis: there is one bat Figure 1 . Potential maintenance mechanisms of ebolaviruses in wildlife, according to current knowledge.
