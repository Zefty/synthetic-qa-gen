Using stochastic processes to model new memory generation and passive attrition and to judge their impact on the entire memory compartment.
In this paper, the number of cells in a lineage is proportional to its weight.
We start with an initial repertoire m and first obtain peak repertoires with κ c cells either by directly computing the probabilities with the weighted proliferation model or by sampling variates from the unweighted model.
We consider repertoires with two lineages and small memory compartment sizes, and with these we identify subtle repertoire changes that are difficult to discern in larger compartments.
Acute viral infections trigger cognate or cross-reactive naive and memory CD8 + T-cells to differentiate into effector cells, which proliferate and eliminate the virus.
Active attrition has little impact on the memory repertoire if an antigen-induced proliferative response leading to new memory cell generation occurs.
We compare active attrition and passive attrition to see if active attrition permanently alters preexisting immunity to other infections.

A sharper focus on social inequalities in bioethics within the on-going discussion on cultural diversity will certainly clarify universal thresholds regarding health status and reinforce key objectives of social justice.

Magnetic Relaxation and Its Application to the Study of Atomic Defects .
The recovery process at 125 K is associated with small clusters of self-interstitials formed by the trapping of single interstitials during recovery of the 110 K process.
Early a-Fe subgroups represent satellites of the intrinsic 200 K relaxation, resulting from reorientable complexes formed by trapping of mobile Stage III defects at impurity atoms.
The size-factor model predicts repulsive forces between self-interstitials and impurities which should give rise to relatively simple MAE Magnetic Relaxation and Its Application to the Study of Atomic Defects.
In dilute FeNi systems, the transformation sequence 110 K 3 80 K has been found to be governed by a reaction order close to 1 .
A growth, probably due to the simultaneous break-down of the 118 K relaxation.
Attributing the 165 K process to a crowdion which is bound to a dumbbell, the above reactions may be explained as follows:
On further anneal, the 95 K process recovers rapidly as a result of thermally activated dissociation; its released constituents ± ± Fe and Mn crowdions ± ± give rise to a series of well-known processes at 64, 82, 52 and 108 K.
