Only 17 patients received a course of antibiotics that finally covered C. spp.
We were not able to evaluate the clinical response of treating these infections: even if it seems justified to treat C. spp. when its impact is high, this strategy does not seem to lower mortality, probably due to the overall morbidity of the patients.
