A task force on the use of RBC, platelet, and plasma for critically ill patients .
An evidence-based recommendation for PICO-based decision framework .
Restrictive transfusion during prolonged weaning from mechanical ventilation .
Inadequacy of the available evidence is inadequate for formulating a recommendation.
Small-volume blood collection tubes in critically ill patients may be challenging, for several reasons, including: need to train staff to draw reduced volumes using less vacuum; need to redraw blood from the patients if insufficient sampling and small blood volumes may provide less opportunity to store blood for future testing.
Prophylactic platelet transfusions in this range may not be acceptable to most clinicians.
There is a need to study very elderly-patients at the extremes of age, given competing concerns about increased risk of ischaemia without transfusion, risk of volume overload, and conversely the possibility of tolerating lower haemoglobin levels due to chronic anemia.
The acceptability of omitting plasma varies between centres and countries . Implementation of this recommendation may require significant knowledge translation efforts to induce a change in clinical practice.
