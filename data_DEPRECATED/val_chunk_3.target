MERS-CoV has a broad tropism, replicating better in some cells lines and eliciting a more proinflammatory response than SARS.
Antibody Detection Assays for MERS-CoV .
Co-detections with MERS-CoV are often negative for other pathogens . However, many studies make no mention of additional testing for endemic respiratory viruses .
MERS-CoV has been detected in DC samples, and recovery of infectious virus has also been achieved.
Contacts of confirmed MERS cases were often observed for clinical illness, but not tested.
Contact tracing can identify potential new infections and through active or passive monitoring, react more rapidly if disease does develop.
The MERS-CoV appears to be an enzootic virus infecting the DC URT with evidence of recent genetic recombination.

The EBOV virus has been found in many forest hosts, including invertebrates, bats, monkeys, rodents, and small mammals.
Bat flies and mosquitoes are potential hosts for fever-like viruses to bats .
EBOV transmission routes towards bats represent interhost contacts of unknown intensity and frequency, and it would be difficult to compare their relative importance.
