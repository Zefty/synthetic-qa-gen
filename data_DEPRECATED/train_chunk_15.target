Daily incidence and epidemic dynamics of the four models at different parameter regimes .
The coefficients of this linear relationship have been determined empirically to carry more weight from values of the SAR associated to more moderate and realistic differences in susceptibility and infectivity of children versus adults .
Stratification to more age groups could lead to some non-trivial unidentifiability problems in mapping relative infectivities and susceptibilities from agestratified incidence.
We propose an efficient method for mapping the parameter space of model AH without integrating the system dynamics.
R 0 for model H follows the method of 47,60 .
The term map is used to imply that the basic model parameters are not estimated from the observables using a statistical procedure.

We treat the elements / ij of the affinity matrix as private choice variables.
We assume individuals observe the state of an epidemic at time t and make a forecast for the epidemiological trajectory over the interval s.
The differential equation framework, coupled with the fact that there is a nonzero infectious population with potentially a very large susceptible population, the infection will again spread, potentially causing additional peaks.
The net effect of private disease risk mitigation is therefore given by the combined impact of two things: the marginal reduction in the infection rate due to the avoidance of infected people and the marginal increase in infections due to susceptible-asymptomatic contact.
We consider only policy instruments determined in advance of an epidemic-i.e., that correspond to the known properties of known diseases-we acknowledge that this would not be reasonable in the case of novel or emerging diseases.

Geocomputation-the tools and methodologies of geographic computing-within this spectrum of approaches is unclear, and more importantly, selecting the appropriate approach for a given study objective is increasingly difficult.
We apply geocomputation to landscape epidemiology, which was described originally by Pavlovksy as the concept of the 'natural nidality of human diseases', recognizing that the sources of human disease existed naturally in the environment.
A technological approach to this step might be that of HealthMap which provides integration of reported health events obtained from the web from all over the world . Through scraping, geocoding, and mapping health event data in a common platform, this platform provides the capacity for 'epidemic intelligence'.
We propose a series of scenarios that might lead to the observed pattern.

A three-year review of long-term issues for EFSA .
The Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed is maintained by the European Commission and includes daily updates of food safety events notified within the European Union.
The utility of these data sources are summarised as "no", "possible", "limited" or "yes" under EFSA's definition of emerging risks.
On the basis of this and as a follow up of the 1st International Conference on Risk Assessment and of the 4 th meeting of the Chairs and Secretariats of Commission and agency scientific committee and panels involved in risk assessment, held in Parma in 2008, it was agreed that the EFSA

Nanoscience and nanotechnology for food and nutraceuticals.
An inspection and gross tissue examination can support the collection of appropriate samples for residue monitoring.
A change to visual inspection would reduce detection effectiveness for tuberculosis in small ruminants.
Visual detection of faecal contamination on carcasses can also be an indicator of slaughter hygiene, but other approaches should be considered.
Extended use of food chain information has the potential to compensate for some, but not all, of the information on animal health and welfare that would be lost if visual only post-mortem inspection is applied.
Inspections for hazards currently not covered by the meat inspection system, as well as recommendations for adaptations of inspection methods and/or frequencies of inspections that provide an equivalent level of protection.
Cross-contamination of animal carcasses can spread bacterial hazards through cross contamination, and palpation and incision should be omitted.
In this opinion, when referring to handling and preparation this should be interpreted as handling of sheep and goat meat that occurs immediately prior to consumption, when these activities are carried out by consumers or professional food handlers.
The final outcome of this process involved categorising each hazard as high or low priority, as follows:
Infection of the skin and mucosa by the bacterium, "Clostridium difficile", which is resistant to most antibiotics.
VTEC is capable of causing disease in humans.
Salmonella spp. in sheep and goats carcasses from 2004 to 2011 .
The remaining identified hazards, B. anthracis, Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella spp, were classified as low priority, based on the available data.
Ante-mortem inspection helps in identifying dirty animals, as required by current legislation.
Judgement of the fitness of meat for human consumption in current post-mortem inspection is based on the identification of "conditions making meat unfit forhuman consumption" but does not make a clear foodborne risk distinction between different subcategories.
In the process of creating PHC for abattoirs, the possibilities that need to be considered are whether they should be linked to individual stages of the process or only related to the starting and the end point.
Control of pathogenic VTEC at farm level is complicated by the fact that animals are asymptomatic carriers of these organisms, thus without an active monitoring programme there is no way of knowing which animals are infected and/or shedding at any given time.
Clean animals for slaughter as currently required by EU legislation, as it can be assumed that the dirtier the animals are in terms of faecal material, the higher the risk of cross-contamination of the slaughterline environment.
Optimisation of balancing pathogenic VTEC risk categories for small ruminants with risk categories of abattoirs where they are to be slaughtered.
In the event that these studies confirm a high risk to public health through the consumption of meat from sheep or goats, consideration should be given to the setting of clear and measurable EU targets at the carcass level.
Foodborne Yersiniosis is caused primarily by Yersinia enterocolitica, with pseudotuberculosis representing a low fraction of isolates from human cases reported.

A situation may be required, which should be updated on a regular basis.
The prescriptive sampling system allows for equivalence in the control of EU-produced sheep and goat meat.
The combination of data from both sheep and goats into one data set assumes that both food chains are identical, which is not the case.
Welfare conditions related to foot and leg disorders would be detectable only if the animals are observed during walking, e.g. unloading or moving to lairage pens, and are also less likely to be detected by visual examination during PMI.
Orf and other exotic diseases and welfare conditions, considered to be more adversely affected in terms of probability of detection following the proposed changes to the MI system, were considered.
Small ruminants are not considered to represent a significant reservoir of the disease for other animals or to be of any significance in the persistence of bTB in cattle.
The EU Regulation No 852/2004 54 requires slaughterhouse operators to request FCI declarations to ensure animals entering the food chain are safe for human consumption.
Welfare assessment protocols using appropriate animal based indicators during clinical and slaughterhouse surveillance systems would improve the welfare of small ruminants.
