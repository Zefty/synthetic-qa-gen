A summary of parameter settings used in this paper.
Social distancing intervention strategies suitable for a developing country may be significantly less effective in reducing the attack rate when compared to that of a developed country.
Household size moderates individual-to-individual transmission probability in larger households.
The field survey provided numbers resident in each of these locations: the two settlement areas in Madang with ~750 inhabitants each; 3,000 students and staff living in hostels at the Divine Word University and Chinese workers at a mine/processing site on the edge of town.
The effectiveness of social distancing interventions, such as school or workplace closure, may be quantified by comparing the passage of the influenza virus in the community with and without interventions activated.
School closure based interventions are less effective in a PNG setting since they are not targeted at household transmission, and given the larger household sizes, are applicable to a smaller proportion of transmissions.
An explicit contact network linking households, schools, workplaces and other meeting places .
An epidemic that is initially suppressed by a rigorous intervention strategy may subsequently break out if intervention measures are relaxed.

Approximate method for approximation method in computer vision.
Voluntary withdrawal from work or school has a more pronounced effect in the Albany model, as a significant proportion of children in Madang still transmit through daytime contacts in neighbourhood hubs.
We use 40 stochastic realizations for the calculation of the means and 95% confidence intervals.
This raises issues regarding how to optimise antiviral delivery and who would fund and manage such a program.
The majority of transmission occurs in household and neighbourhood hubs in the Madang models and less in the wider community.
To capture mixing which occurs out with these locales and in the wider community.
One new infection per day was introduced into the population during the whole period of the simulations, and randomly allocated to a household.
Social distancing strategies are much less effective in a PNG setting compared with what might be achieved in a developed country.

This article is to consider some of the major ways to engineer live vaccines, especially with respect to the ability to limit this post-engineering evolution.
A permanent attenuation with R 0 > 1 raises the possibility of extinguishing a wild-type virus and then maintaining a self-perpetuating, transmissible vaccine that would suppress any reintroduction of the wild type.

Deletions are feasible in a live vaccine only if the deleted elements are not essential for growth.
