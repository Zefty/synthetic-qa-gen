Contact matrices: depending on other parameter, certain values of θ might lead to a violation of the natural requirement that c * 11 ≥ 0.

We take from Fraser et al. values of R 0, φ ≈ 2, ψ ≈ 1 and SAR estimates of about 30%, which from Supplementary Tables 10 and 12 corresponds to a p aa ≈ 0.3.

We have rejected a simple model when its output is more than 5% different from that of model AH.

Memory CD8 + T-cells define the memory repertoire, and the repertoire determines the breadth of diseases against which the host is immune.
The active attrition model includes only memory cells and allows for the influx of a repertoire n with n c newly differentiated naive cells across N lineages that will contribute to refilling the memory compartment.
We use the limit of the weighted proliferation model to find the conditional probability distribution for the final size of each lineage based on each attrition outcome.
We compare the dynamics of viruses that induce active attrition followed by lymphopenic proliferation, more classical infections characterized by new memory cell generation and combinations in which an activeattrition-inducing virus sparks an antigen-activated immune response.
Memory cells proliferate in mice genetically incapable of producing T-cells .
Lymphopenic proliferation might instead occur in scenarios that involve larger compartment sizes relative to the peak of the immune response.
We determine that naive cell precursor sizes and weights are important, and lineages with the largest effective number of newly differentiated lineages are important.
Small numbers may underestimate true shifts, and greater expansion will likely exacerbate the differences between immunity loss due to antigen-induced proliferation and passive attrition.
