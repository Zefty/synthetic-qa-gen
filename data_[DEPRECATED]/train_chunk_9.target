The crystal structure of the XD-N TAIL486-505 complex , which encompasses the a-MoRE , was inserted in the shape using the program SUPCOMB .
The far-UV CD spectrum of XD is typical of a structured protein with a predominant ahelical content, as indicated by the positive ellipticity between 185 nm and 200 nm and by the two minima at 208 nm and 222 nm.
Complex formation between N TAIL and XD implies two types of interaction: one, mediated by residues belonging to Box2, involves a significant gain of a-helicity, while the other, attributable to Box3 residues, is not accompanied by a significant structural transition.
We have shown that the interaction of N TAIL with XD involves an additional, previously unreported site that gains a-helical structure upon binding to XD.
TAILD3 amplification product cloned into the pDest14 vector .
The scattering pattern of the N TAILHN -XD complex was obtained following this process: to avoid any possible bias on absolute intensities due to the concentration, the experimental merged scattering curves obtained as described above were normalized by their theoretical I.

Interventions are less effective in a PNG setting since they are not targeted at household transmission, and given the larger household sizes, are applicable to a smaller proportion of transmissions compared to the Australian scenario.
The timing of the interventions relative to the outcomes of the epidemic is important to assess their effectiveness, especially when there are two or more socialdistancing interventions involved.
We have extended the Sensitivity analysis section to include the results from varying the timing of interventions as follows:
Low-income countries generally have population health profiles not seen in developed countries, including malaria, tuberculosis and HIV.
A moderately transmissible pandemic occurring in PNG may be expected to result in a larger illness attack rate compared with that in a developed country setting.
Contact between the wider Madang population and those at the University involved household and neighbourhood contacts for local students and staff living in town while resident staff and students were restricted to community contact.
Improving the seeding rate for a sustained local epidemic has little effect on the progress of the local epidemic, as the number of imported cases is much smaller.

In our inferences, while gross differences in bottleneck size can be identified, high level of precision is difficult to obtain from sequence data alone.
Their method obtains a correct inference under these circumstances but reports false.
Neutral markers can be added to a viral population without providing an estimate of selection, and sequencing these markers before and after transmission can give a precise estimate of the population bottleneck.
We propose a fitness model for selection of haplotypes.
We obtain by the law of total expectation, we obtain the integral over q A.
Transmission was modelled as a multinomial draw of depth equal to the bottleneck size and selection was incorporated as a shift in haplotype frequencies as described in Eq 8.

A weak maximum with a retarded decrease at higher temperatures , possibly caused by the simultaneous decay of a relatively strong 165 K relaxation.
