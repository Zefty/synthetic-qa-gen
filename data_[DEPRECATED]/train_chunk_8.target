A reanalysis of other studies and also on new data is that the level of attenuation for eukaryotic viruses depends chiefly on the number of CpG and UpA dinucleotides created by the codon changes.

Common knowledge of prior art is reasonable because previous patents are public, publishing firms want to be sure the patent examiner has access to their ideas, innovating firms make efforts to be informed about the prior art.
In general, publications prolong the race but may improve a follower's probability of catching up with the leader.
In the investment race, high investments can expedite innovation. When the probability of success is fixed, the race must be longer than in a race with no publications.
On the other hand, possibly less incentive to invest and more inefficient duplication.
