The PICO task force developed evidence summaries for each PICO question, including information on study design, population, intervention, pooled estimates of effect for each outcome.
The panel made a conditional recommendation for a restrictive strategy, noting that the certainty of evidence was low for all outcomes other than 1-year mortality and need for RRT.
We do not make a recommendation for a restrictive vs. a liberal transfusion threshold in critically ill adults undergoing veno-venous or venoarterial ECMO.
Clinical findings suggesting bleeding are reasonable indications to transfuse if bleeding is suspected-in the absence of suspected bleeding, these findings should not be used as transfusion triggers and haemoglobin/ haematocrit triggers should generally be used.
Small-volume blood collection tubes may result in a reduced daily volume of blood loss , and need for blood transfusion .
This trial was stopped early because of the small number of bleeding events and clinicians became reluctant to provide prophylactic transfusions to correct mild coagulopathy.

The history of the human viral challenge model, from the first documented HVC study with smallpox on the 14 th of May 1796 to the use of chimpanzees in the study of influenza.

We set about designing possibly the first HVC/RSV study.
The HVC model can be used to identify infected individuals before they become symptomatic; this could be vitally important in the event of a pandemic .
