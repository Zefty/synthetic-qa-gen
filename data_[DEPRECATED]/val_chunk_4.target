A. Inclusion of multiple "central and peripheral nervous system disorders" in one study , which accounts for 1/3 of events .
The PICO task force developed evidence summaries for each PICO question, including information on study design, population, intervention, pooled estimates of effect for each outcome.
The panel made a conditional recommendation for a restrictive strategy, noting that the certainty of evidence was low for all outcomes other than 1-year mortality and need for RRT.
We do not make a recommendation for a restrictive vs. a liberal transfusion threshold in critically ill adults undergoing veno-venous or venoarterial ECMO.
Clinical findings suggesting bleeding are reasonable indications to transfuse if bleeding is suspected-in the absence of suspected bleeding, these findings should not be used as transfusion triggers and haemoglobin/ haematocrit triggers should generally be used.

The history of the human viral challenge model, from the first documented HVC study with smallpox on the 14 th of May 1796 to the use of chimpanzees in the study of influenza.
In contemporary HVC trials, healthy volunteers are administered an investigational therapeutic either before or after inoculation with the specific challenge strain of the virus.
We set about designing possibly the first HVC/RSV study.
The HVC model can be used to identify infected individuals before they become symptomatic; this could be vitally important in the event of a pandemic .
