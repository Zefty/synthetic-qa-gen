We hope that this paper will go a way towards advancing this objective, and that this debate stimulates discussion of the ethical issues and values that pervade pandemic planning.

What exactly constitutes communication by reference to certain forms or content?
St stigmatised individuals avoid treatment and testing because they fear being exposed to the judgemental attitudes of medical professionals who they believe are likely to hold negative feelings.
The second reason relates to the fact that many anti-discrimination approaches are designed so as to apply only in specific contexts.
Administrative tribunals can act as a gateway by which decisions can be reviewed in the light of such important legal principles.
Eliminate medical bodies from the medical register, erase them from medical register.
The existence of legal frameworks capable of allowing private individuals to alter or halt such processes would also represent a diminution in the utility of the communicational tools available to the state.
This paper has established that there is a lack of control concerning public communication activities in the context of crisis and the author has not sought to argue for an alternative arrangement whereby purely expressive acts made by the state would be subject to a much broader range of legal controls than they are at present.

Risk Assessment and Risk Management during MG: Attention to the following factors has proven valuable in assessing risks/outbreaks during previous MG:
Risk assessment in preparation for a mass gathering includes the evaluation of the potential public health impacts of the event.
Crowding, lack of sufficient access to hygiene facilities, and/or the presence of disease vectors •
Measles at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games was relatively low, for three main reasons.
The duration of an event may dictate the types of disease that should receive surveillance priority during the planning stage.
Smaller health care facilities and local health practitioners are more likely to see patients with low grade symptoms, and then choose not to pursue additional medical treatment.
Key stakeholders and reporting requirements for all surveillance systems • Considering implementation of an epidemiologic and surveillance coordination team.
Numbers of patients with a similar syndrome having unusual characteristics or high morbidity or mortality •
A system should be in place to monitor issues of interest in source nations constantly, so that new and relevant information becomes known, it can be factored quickly into plans and accounted for in responses .
Towards a safe and reliable system for internal transport and external shipment of clinical specimens for testing, and of isolates for quality control.
Coordination with security, intelligence and law enforcement authorities to help locate and identify key or index cases and their contacts.
Security and protection of personnel and patients not associated with the MG from the effects of the incident.
Post-decontamination medical assessment, treatment and care processes for decontaminated ambulant and non-ambulant victims and patients.
Large numbers of persons who are not at-risk but who are concerned may clog the medical system, interfering with response measures.
Quarantine measures are not effective for preventing communicable disease from spreading between humans.
Large-scale quarantining of large numbers of people is logistically difficult, and control measures perceived as coercive or punitive may be counter-productive.
Planning MGs that attract an international cross-section of participants and visitors should determine the availability of relevant interpretation/translation services early in the planning process.
The plan is tested and validated to ensure all aspects of the plan are carried out effectively, and that resources can be focused on those aspects that are still not sufficiently mastered.
Communication with the public and media attention brought about by hosting an MG can be one of the most demanding aspects of the gathering.
Triage of media requests and inquiries, production of media advisories, press releases, fact-sheets, b-roll footage, etc.
A vast array of new skills and resources will be needed to support the MG, and they will be functioning together in novel ways.
Health authorities can request assistance during an MG and possibly from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network .
Communication is the backbone of any plan or response, and it is vital for implementers of the CD plan to be able to communicate information and instructions.

Extinction probabilities in a single infection given an initial repertoire given a variety of repertoires, weights, degrees of attrition, and proliferation peaks .
Smaller compartment sizes are less biodiverse than larger compartment sizes.
Attrition does not change the ratio of mean cells in lineage 1 versus lineage 2; only proliferation does this.

The attrition and proliferation models could be expanded to consider chronic or autoimmune diseases that significantly narrow the memory repertoire through persistent or recurrent T-cell responses directed at a few antigens.
