The EBOV spillover event can be bridged by a small number of forest hosts, including invertebrates, bats, monkeys, rodents, and other small mammals.
EBOV transmission to bats could occur through aerosol transmission in all four habitats.
A set of secondary hypotheses indicated in Table 1 can be tested through protocols presented to further investigate the role of different maintenance host candidates for EBOV.
