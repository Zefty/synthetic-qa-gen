A national strategy for suicide prevention in developing countries.
The World Health Organization (WHO) presents evidence-based interventions for reducing suicides and calls on partners to increase their prevention efforts.
Under-reporting and misclassification are greater problems for suicide than for most other causes of death.
Pesticide self-poisoning is a key method of suicide in LMICs, particularly in countries with a high proportion of rural residents engaged in small-scale agriculture.
For each adult who died of suicide there were likely to be more than 20 others who made one or more suicide attempts.
Selective prevention strategies target vulnerable groups within a population based on characteristics such as age, sex, occupational status or family history.
Carbon monoxide poisoning is a suicide method that can be prevented using domestic gas .

An Air Force programme with accountability and protocols for preventing suicides in the Air Force .
Many risk and protective factors for suicidal behaviours have been identified through epidemiological research.
Twenty-five countries and states have specific laws and punishments for attempted suicide.
A national strategy for suicide prevention is a systematic way of developing a national response.
A logical framework is one of many programme planning and evaluation tools that can be used to help display the connections between the problem to be addressed, the activities to be implemented and the expected results.
A national suicide prevention strategy often requires change in the way individuals and their organizations operate.
A coordinated action for suicide prevention across health-care, social-care services, education, housing, police, welfare and employment services.
This table can be used both to consider how each sector is currently contributing to suicide prevention and to identify opportunities to expand or leverage the contributions of these sectors to engage other partners.
Large government-sponsored suicide prevention studies should require the use of suicide or suicide attempt as the key outcome measures and should allocate an adequate portion of the budget to the monitoring of these outcomes.
Health-care services need to incorporate suicide prevention as a core component.

This study would have strongly discouraged the use of complex households models in favour of purely age-stratified ones.
Only under certain intervention scenarios would it be useful to tease apart models compared in the absence of such interventions; however, this is not a limitation of the current methodology, but rather a typical out-of-sample prediction problem.

The average size of an epidemic in such a household, however, depends also on p aa and φ.

Annealing with low-temperature e À -irradiation .
The monovacancy possesses cubic symmetry of the Fe host lattice and is unable to produce the reorientation-type relaxations observed in the MAE and IF of Stage III.
A consistent interpretation of processes at 50 and 125 K in terms of small intrinsic interstitial complexes is only possible within the framework of a 2IM.
Impurity trapping is seen on annealing above Stage III particularly by the formation of a characteristic, low-temperature relaxation together with a process near 300 K.
The MAE spectrum of Fe 20 at ppm Be starts with a large Stage I process which, on recovery, gives rise to a fairly strong 84 K and a weak 50 K process.
On further anneal, the 84 K complexes are modified, e.g. by conversion of their crowdions into mixed dumb-bells, thus causing a lowering of the original peak temperature to 75 K.
MAE spectra in dilute alloys are so closely related to those occurring in pure a-Fe that, although fully supporting the 2IM interpretations deduced from the Fe results, they are, nevertheless, unable to provide us with further new arguments in favour of any recovery model.
MAE develops from the trapping of intrinsic interstitials at immobile C.
Migrating self-interstitials, rather than vacancies, in Stage III is also in agreement with the corresponding growth of the weaker, interstitialtype complexes at 50/55 and 170 K.
The concept of a V 2 C 1 complex formation in Stage IV is further supported by an analysis of the reaction kinetics of the 18 K process.
