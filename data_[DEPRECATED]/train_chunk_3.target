The number of stay of male and female inpatients despite increases in the number of visits per patient and the hospitalisation rate for both genders during this period.
The decomposition method described in this paper provides empirical evidence that the mean duration of stay plays a very significant role in determining the number of hospitalization days.
The decomposition of hospital admission days per person in year a and year b can be expressed as a product of three factors: the relative discrepancy between mean duration of stay .
The reduction in hospital days per person from 2000 to 2010 of 200.6% is contributed to by the decrease of mean duration of stay, and it is offset by -51.1% due to the Table 2 .
Shortening in-hospital length of stay may be consistent with an orderly and systematic care pathway, but a longer length ofStay might be regarded as appropriate for extended treatment.

Infection rate of individual animals in a herd, per capita detection rate of infected animals within a herd.
We define A ξ as the infectivity of a herd at time t, while the herd was infected τ time units ago and with H = h, where ξ is a two-dimensional vector, denoting the two types of herds involved in the contact.
We use a branching idea to describe the spread of the infection among different herds.
In interval i, denote by D = k the event that this particular herd is detected in interval k, given H = h.
We can only use this property if after time t = T the infection and detection rate are proportional to each other, because otherwise we need to know the ages of the infective herds.
