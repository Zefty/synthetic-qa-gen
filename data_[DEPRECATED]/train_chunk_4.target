Little is lost by the early imposition and subsequent relaxation of social distancing interventions: results indicate that even if schools are closed for 8weeks, the total cost of the pandemic is lower than if no interventions had been enacted.

We define a 'bottleneck' more strictly as a neutral process whereby a finite number of viral particles from one population found a subsequent generation of the population, either within the same host, or across a transmission event from host to recipient.
The population bottleneck and noise contribute to the change in the viral population; where large numbers of viruses are transmitted, most of this signal is likely to result from noise.
The biology of within-host viral growth may affect the inference of a transmission bottleneck.
We propose that the term used in some analyses of viral transmission, of a 'selective bottleneck' is ambiguous, failing to distinguish changes in a population arising from selection and those occurring through stochastic change in the population.
The first component of this likelihood, corresponding to the initial observation of a system, x B , represents a straightforward sampling of the system, drawing from a collection of viral haplotypes.
